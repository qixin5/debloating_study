This directory contains our debloating result. In each tool's directory, there are four files showing the c-generality-related scores for the utility programs (`cgen_related_scores_util.txt`), the c-generality-related scores for the SIR programs (`cgen_related_scores_sir.txt`), the r-generality-related scores for all programs (`rgen_related_scores.txt`), and the debloating scores based on increasing amounts of inputs (`increasing_input_scores.txt`).
