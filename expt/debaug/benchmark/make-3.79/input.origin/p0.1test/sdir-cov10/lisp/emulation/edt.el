;;;; EDT Emulation Commands
;;;;

;;; Almost all of EDT's keypad mode commands have equivalent
;;; counterparts in Emacs.  Some behave the same way in Emacs as they
;;; do in EDT, but most do not.
;;;
;;; The following Emacs functions emulate, where practical, the exact
;;; behavior of the corresponding EDT keypad mode commands.  In a few
;;; cases, the emulation is not exact, but it is close enough for most
;;; EDT die-hards.
;;;
;;; In a very few cases, we chose to use the superior Emacs way of
;;; handling things.  For example, we do not emulate the EDT SUBS
;;; command.  Instead, we chose to use the superior Emacs
;;; query-replace function.
;;;

;;;
;;; PAGE
;;;
;;; Emacs uses the regexp assigned to page-delimiter to determine what
;;; marks a page break.  This is normally "^\f", which causes the
;;; edt-page command to ignore form feeds not located at the beginning
;;; of a line.  To emulate the EDT PAGE command exactly,
;;; page-delimiter is set to "\f" when EDT emulation is turned on, and
;;; restored to its original value when EDT emulation is turned off.
;;; But this can be overridden if the EDT definition is not desired by
;;; placing
;;;
;;;         (setq edt-keep-current-page-delimiter t)
;;;
;;; in your .emacs file.
