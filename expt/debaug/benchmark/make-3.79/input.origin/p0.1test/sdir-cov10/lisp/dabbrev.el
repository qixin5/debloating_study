;;; Commentary:

;; The purpose with this package is to let you write just a few
;; characters of words you've written earlier to be able to expand
;; them.
;;
;; To expand a word, just put the point right after the word and press
;; M-/ (dabbrev-expand) or M-C-/ (dabbrev-completion).
;;
;; Check out the customizable variables below to learn about all the
;; features of this package.

;;; Hints and tips for major modes writers:

;; Recommended values		C/Lisp etc	text
;; dabbrev-case-fold-search	nil		t
;; dabbrev-case-replace		nil		t
;;
;; Set the variables you want special for your mode like this:
;; (set (make-local-variable 'dabbrev-case-replace) nil)
;; Then you don't interfere with other modes.
;;
;; If your mode handles buffers that refers to other buffers
;; (i.e. compilation-mode, gud-mode), then try to set
;; `dabbrev-select-buffers-function' or `dabbrev-friend-buffer-function'
;; to a function that point out those buffers.

;; Same goes for major-modes that are connected to other modes.  There
;; are for instance a number of mail-modes.  One for reading, one for
;; creating a new mail etc.  Maybe those should be connected.

;; Example for GNUS (when we write a reply, we want dabbrev to look in
;; the article for expansion):
;; (set (make-local-variable 'dabbrev-friend-buffer-function)
;;      (lambda (buffer)
;;         (save-excursion
;;           (set-buffer buffer)
;;           (memq major-mode '(news-reply-mode gnus-article-mode)))))


;; Known bugs and limitations.
;; - Possible to do several levels of `dabbrev-completion' in the
;;   minibuffer.
;; - dabbrev-completion doesn't handle resetting the globals variables
;;   right.  It resets them after finding the abbrev.

;; Future enhancements
;;  - Check the tags-files? Like tags-complete?
;;  - Add the possibility of searching both forward and backward to
;;    the nearest expansion.
;;  - Check the kill-ring when everything else fails.  (Maybe something
;;  for hippie-expand?).  [Bng] <boris@cs.rochester.edu>

previous word-start, but the search is for symbols.

For instance, if you are programming in Lisp, `yes-or-no-p' is a symbol,
while `yes', `or', `no' and `p' are considered words.  If this
variable is nil, then expanding `yes-or-no-' looks for a symbol
starting with or containing `no-'.  If you set this variable to
\"\\\\sw\\\\|\\\\s_\", that expansion looks for a symbol starting with
`yes-or-no-'.  Finally, if you set this variable to \"\\\\sw\", then
expanding `yes-or-no-' signals an error because `-' is not part of a word;
but expanding `yes-or-no' looks for a word starting with `no'.

The recommended value is \"\\\\sw\\\\|\\\\s_\"."
