;;; Commentary:

;; Commands to send the region or a buffer your printer.  Entry points
;; are `lpr-buffer', `print-buffer', lpr-region', or `print-region'; option
;; variables include `printer-name', `lpr-switches' and `lpr-command'.

  "*The name of a local printer to which data is sent for printing.
\(Note that PostScript files are sent to `ps-printer-name', which see.\)

On Unix-like systems, a string value should be a name understood by
lpr's -P option; otherwise the value should be nil.

On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, a string value is taken as the name of
a printer device or port, provided `lpr-command' is set to \"\".
Typical non-default settings would be \"LPT1\" to \"LPT3\" for parallel
printers, or \"COM1\" to \"COM4\" or \"AUX\" for serial printers, or
\"//hostname/printer\" for a shared network printer.  You can also set
it to the name of a file, in which case the output gets appended to that
file.  If you want to discard the printed output, set this to \"NUL\"."
