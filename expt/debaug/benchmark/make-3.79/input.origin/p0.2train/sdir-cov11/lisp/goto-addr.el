;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows you to click or hit a key sequence while on a
;; URL or e-mail address, and either load the URL into a browser of
;; your choice using the browse-url package, or if it's an e-mail
;; address, to send an e-mail to that address.  By default, we bind to
;; the [mouse-2] and the [C-c return] key sequences.

;; INSTALLATION
;;
;; To use goto-address in a particular mode (for example, while
;; reading mail in mh-e), add something like this in your .emacs file:
;; 
;; (add-hook 'mh-show-mode-hook 'goto-address)
;;
;; By default, goto-address now sends using `mail' instead of `mh-send'.
;; To use mh-e to send mail, add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;; (setq goto-address-mail-method 'goto-address-send-using-mh-e)
;;
;; The mouse click method is bound to [mouse-2] on highlighted URL's or
;; e-mail addresses only; it functions normally everywhere else.  To bind
;; another mouse click to the function, add the following to your .emacs
;; (for example):
;;
;; (setq goto-address-highlight-keymap
;;   (let ((m (make-sparse-keymap)))
;;     (define-key m [S-mouse-2] 'goto-address-at-mouse)
;;     m))
;;

;; BUG REPORTS
;;
;; Please send bug reports to me at ericding@mit.edu.

;; Known bugs/features:
;; * goto-address-mail-regexp only catches foo@bar.org style addressing,
;;   not stuff like X.400 addresses, etc.
;; * regexp also catches Message-Id line, since it is in the format of
;;   an Internet e-mail address (like Compuserve addresses)
;; * If show buffer is fontified after goto-address-fontify is run
;;   (say, using font-lock-fontify-buffer), then font-lock face will
;;   override goto-address faces.
