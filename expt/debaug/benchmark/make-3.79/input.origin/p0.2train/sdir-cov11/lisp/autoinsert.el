;;; Commentary:

;;  The following defines an association list for text to be
;;  automatically inserted when a new file is created, and a function
;;  which automatically inserts these files; the idea is to insert
;;  default text much as the mode is automatically set using
;;  auto-mode-alist.
;;
;;  To use: 
;;     (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'auto-insert)
;;     setq auto-insert-directory to an appropriate slash-terminated value
;;
;;  You can also customize the variable `auto-insert-mode' to load the
;;  package.  Alternatively, add the following to your .emacs file:
;;  (auto-insert-mode 1)

Elements look like (CONDITION . ACTION) or ((CONDITION . DESCRIPTION) . ACTION).
CONDITION maybe a regexp that must match the new file's name, or it may be
a symbol that must match the major mode for this element to apply.
Only the first matching element is effective.
Optional DESCRIPTION is a string for filling `auto-insert-prompt'.
ACTION may be a skeleton to insert (see `skeleton-insert'), an absolute
file-name or one relative to `auto-insert-directory' or a function to call.
ACTION may also be a vector containing several successive single actions as
described above, e.g. [\"header.insert\" date-and-author-update]."
