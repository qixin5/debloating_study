;;; Commentary:

;; This package emulates the mark, copy, cut and paste look-and-feel of motif
;; programs (which is the same as the MAC gui and (sorry for that) MS-Windows).
;; It modifies the keybindings of the cursor keys and the next, prior,
;; home and end keys. They will modify mark-active.
;; You can still get the old behaviour of cursor moving with the
;; control sequences C-f, C-b, etc.
;; This package uses transient-mark-mode and
;; delete-selection-mode.
;;
;; In addition to that all key-bindings from the pc-mode are 
;; done here too (as suggested by RMS).
;;
;; As I found out after I finished the first version, s-region.el tries
;; to do the same.... But my code is a little more complete and using
;; delete-selection-mode is very important for the look-and-feel.
;; Pete Forman <pete.forman@airgun.wg.waii.com> provided some motif
;; compliant keybindings which I added. I had to modify them a little
;; to add the -mark and -nomark functionality of cursor moving.
;;
;; Credits:
;; Many thanks to all who made comments.
;; Thanks to RMS and Ralf Muschall <prm@rz.uni-jena.de> for criticism.
;; Kevin Cutts <cutts@ukraine.corp.mot.com> added the beginning-of-buffer
;; and end-of-buffer functions which I modified a little.
;; David Biesack <sasdjb@unx.sas.com> suggested some more cleanup.
;; Thanks to Pete Forman <pete.forman@airgun.wg.waii.com>
;; for additional motif keybindings.
;; Thanks to jvromans@squirrel.nl (Johan Vromans) for a bug report
;; concerning setting of this-command.
;; Dan Nicolaescu <done@ece.arizona.ro> suggested suppressing the
;; scroll-up/scroll-down error.
;; Eli Barzilay (eli@cs.bgu.ac.il) suggested the sexps functions and
;; keybindings. 
;;
;; Ok, some details about the idea of pc-selection-mode:
;;
;;  o The standard keys for moving around (right, left, up, down, home, end,
;;    prior, next, called "move-keys" from now on) will always de-activate
;;    the mark.
;;  o If you press "Shift" together with the "move-keys", the region
;;    you pass along is activated
;;  o You have the copy, cut and paste functions (as in many other programs)
;;    which will operate on the active region
;;    It was not possible to bind them to C-v, C-x and C-c for obvious
;;    emacs reasons.
;;    They will be bound according to the "old" behaviour to S-delete (cut),
;;    S-insert (paste) and C-insert (copy). These keys do the same in many
;;    other programs.
