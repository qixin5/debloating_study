;;;
;;; Functions for composing Tibetan character.
;;;
;;; A Tibetan syllable is typically structured as follows:
;;;
;;;      [Prefix] C [C+] V [M] [Suffix [Post suffix]]
;;;
;;; where C's are all vertically stacked, V appears below or above
;;; consonant cluster and M is always put above the C[C+]V combination.
;;; (Sanskrit visarga, though it is a vowel modifier, is considered
;;;  to be a punctuation.)
;;;
;;; Here are examples of the words "bsgrubs" and "h'uM"
;;;
;;;            $(7"7(B2$(7%q`"U(B1$(7"7"G(B         2$(7"H`#A`"U0"_(B1        
;;;
;;;                             M
;;;             b s b s         h
;;;               g             '
;;;               r             u
;;;               u
;;;
;;; Consonants ''', 'w', 'y', 'r' take special forms when they are used
;;; as subjoined consonant. Consonant 'r' takes another special form
;;; when used as superjoined as in "rka", and so on, while it does not
;;; change its form when conjoined with subjoined ''', 'w' or 'y'
;;; as in "rwa", "rya".
;;;
;;;
;;; As a Tibetan input method should avoid using conversion key,
;;; we use a "Tibetan glyph -> transcription -> Tibetan glyph"
;;; translation at each key input.
;;;
;;; 1st stage -  Check the preceding char.
;;;              If the preceding char is Tibetan and composable, then
;;;
;;; 2nd stage -  Translate the preceding char into transcription
;;;
;;; 3rd stage -  Concatenate the transcription of preceding char
;;;              and the current input key.
;;;
;;; 4th stage -  Re-translate the concatenated transcription into
;;;              a sequence of Tibetan letters.
;;;
;;; 5th stage -  Convert leading consonants into one single precomposed char
;;;              if possible.
;;;
;;; 6th stage -  Compose the consonants into one composite glyph.
;;;
;;; (If the current input is a vowel sign or a vowel modifier,
;;;  then it is composed with preceding char without checking
;;;  except when the preceding char is a punctuation or a digit.)
;;;
;;;

;;; This function is used to avoid composition
;;;      between Tibetan and non-Tibetan chars.
