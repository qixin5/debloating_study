GNU Service Directory
---------------------

This is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs, for a fee
or in some cases at no charge.

The information comes from the people who asked to be listed;
we do not include any information we know to be false, but we
cannot check out any of the information; we are transmitting it to
you as it was given to us and do not promise it is correct.
Also, this is not an endorsement of the people listed here.
We have no opinions and usually no information about the abilities of
any specific person.  We provide this list to enable you to contact
service providers and decide for yourself whether to hire one.

Before FSF will list your name in the GNU Service Directory, we ask
that you agree informally to the following terms:

1. You will not restrict (except by copyleft) the use or distribution
of any software, documentation, or other information you supply anyone
in the course of modifying, extending, or supporting GNU software.
This includes any information specifically designed to ameliorate the
use of GNU software.

2. You will not take advantage of contact made through the Service
Directory to advertise an unrelated business (e.g., sales of
non-GNU-related proprietary information).  You may spontaneously
mention your availability for general consulting, but you should not
promote a specific unrelated business unless the client asks.

Please include some indication of your rates, because otherwise users
have nothing to go by.	Please put each e-mail address inside "<>".
Please put nothing else inside "<>".  Thanks!

What I do:
        Primarily I work on GNU software for VMS, both VAX and AXP.  I've
        been porting GNU Emacs to VMS since spring 1991.  I've  ported a
        bunch of other GNU programs as well.  I maintain GNU vmslib.
        For further info, see http://www.lp.se/~levitte/prof/resume.html

Programs supported:
        To a varying degree (ranging from extension and porting to
        installation and simple questions) at the time of updating this
        entry:
        - GNU vmslib, emacs, autoconf, zip, diffutils, m4, patch, texinfo,
          C/C++; on both VMS and Unix.
        - Other GNU programs to a small degree; on Unix.
        For further info, look at http://www.lp.se/products/gnu.html

Experience:
        Fluent in TeX/LaTeX and many programming languages.
        Modified key elements in Emacs (e.g., memory and process management)
        to work transparently on VMS.  I have very good knowledge in the VMS
        operating system.  I'm also knowledged in the a few Unix flavors.
        For further info, see http://www.lp.se/~levitte/prof/resume.html

Your Rate:
        $70-$100/hour (500-800 SEK in sweden), plus expenses.  My rates
        are negotiable, depending on how interesting the project is to me.

COMMERCIAL PROFESSIONAL CONSULTANCY:
	- Please state you want to pay for consultancy at commercial rates,

! NO FREE HELP !
	- I Am Not A Help Desk !  I have no time to do that.
	  Neither the FSF nor anyone else pays me to offer any such service.
	- I contribute  source code to the public domain, but I sell my time,
	  which is Not available as a public service.
	- I dislike phone calls from strangers seeking free advice on things
	  I may well not know enough about.  Post such questions to an Internet
	  newsgroup or list (via a friend if you don't have Internet access)
	  & let someone with time, best knowledge, & inclination answer.
	- If you must phone me, immediately ask for a few minutes advice 
	  "Free Of Charge" (else if you just swamp me in technicalities
	  without first having the decency to let me know you'r Not a potential
	  paying customer, you'r just encouraging me to hang up).
	- Give me an email address, so I can forward follow-up info.
        - Volunteer to phone back next week to hear subsequent info/solutions/
          questions I/friends/net have come up with meantime: Almost always the
          information I have instantly to hand is a small fraction of the
          useful information I could provide. I despise those who do not phone
          back later, after I've spent time researching their problem; but I
          refuse to also waste my money on long distance calls to inform them
          what I've previously wasted my time learning for their benefit.
	- Language: Make an effort,  speak some English !  Use no German
	  dialect, only Hoch Deutsch.  Spell very slowly & clearly, I am Not
	  good at fast German pronunciation, & don't recognise umlauts !
	- Numbers: Use Only single digits (think of keyboard input), use no
	  inverted German digit pairs (EG no "eight hundred, two and thirty",
	  & no convoluted French (EG "four twenties and fifteen") !
