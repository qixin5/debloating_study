ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means count only the selected frame,

PROC is called with a window as argument.

Optional second arg MINIBUF t means count the minibuffer window even
if not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means count the minibuffer iff
it is active.  MINIBUF neither t nor nil means not to count the
minibuffer even if it is active.

Several frames may share a single minibuffer; if the minibuffer
counts, all windows on all frames that share that minibuffer count
too.  Therefore, if you are using a separate minibuffer frame
and the minibuffer is active and MINIBUF says it counts,
`walk-windows' includes the windows in the frame from which you
entered the minibuffer, as well as the minibuffer window.

ALL-FRAMES is the optional third argument.
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means cycle within the frames as specified above.
ALL-FRAMES = `visible' means include windows on all visible frames.
ALL-FRAMES = 0 means include windows on all visible and iconified frames.
ALL-FRAMES = t means include windows on all frames including invisible frames.
