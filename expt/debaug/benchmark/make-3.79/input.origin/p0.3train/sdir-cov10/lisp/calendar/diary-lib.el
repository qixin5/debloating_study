Returns a list of all relevant diary entries found, if any, in order by date.
The list entries have the form ((month day year) string specifier) where
\(month day year) is the date of the entry, string is the entry text, and
specifier is the applicability.  If the variable `diary-list-include-blanks'
is t, this list includes a dummy diary entry consisting of the empty string)
for a date with no diary entries.

After the list is prepared, the hooks `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook',
`list-diary-entries-hook', `diary-display-hook', and `diary-hook' are run.
These hooks have the following distinct roles:

    `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook' can cull dates from the diary
        and each included file.  Usually used for Hebrew or Islamic
        diary entries in files.  Applied to *each* file.

    `list-diary-entries-hook' adds or manipulates diary entries from
        external sources.  Used, for example, to include diary entries
        from other files or to sort the diary entries.  Invoked *once* only,
        before the display hook is run.

    `diary-display-hook' does the actual display of information.  If this is
        nil, simple-diary-display will be used.  Use add-hook to set this to
        fancy-diary-display, if desired.  If you want no diary display, use
        add-hook to set this to ignore.

    `diary-hook' is run last.  This can be used for an appointment
        notification function."

Sexp diary entries must be prefaced by a `sexp-diary-entry-symbol' (normally
`%%').  The form of a sexp diary entry is

                  %%(SEXP) ENTRY

Both ENTRY and DATE are globally available when the SEXP is evaluated.  If the
SEXP yields the value nil, the diary entry does not apply.  If it yields a
non-nil value, ENTRY will be taken to apply to DATE; if the non-nil value is a
string, that string will be the diary entry in the fancy diary display.

For example, the following diary entry will apply to the 21st of the month
if it is a weekday and the Friday before if the 21st is on a weekend:

      &%%(let ((dayname (calendar-day-of-week date))

A number of built-in functions are available for this type of diary entry:

      %%(diary-date MONTH DAY YEAR) text
                  Entry applies if date is MONTH, DAY, YEAR if
                  `european-calendar-style' is nil, and DAY, MONTH, YEAR if
                  `european-calendar-style' is t.  DAY, MONTH, and YEAR
                  can be lists of integers, the constant t, or an integer.
                  The constant t means all values.

      %%(diary-float MONTH DAYNAME N &optional DAY) text
                  Entry will appear on the Nth DAYNAME of MONTH.
                  (DAYNAME=0 means Sunday, 1 means Monday, and so on;
                  if N is negative it counts backward from the end of
                  the month.  MONTH can be a list of months, a single
                  month, or t to specify all months. Optional DAY means
                  Nth DAYNAME of MONTH on or after/before DAY.  DAY defaults
                  to 1 if N>0 and the last day of the month if N<0.

      %%(diary-block M1 D1 Y1 M2 D2 Y2) text
                  Entry will appear on dates between M1/D1/Y1 and M2/D2/Y2,
                  inclusive.  (If `european-calendar-style' is t, the
                  order of the parameters should be changed to D1, M1, Y1,
                  D2, M2, Y2.)

      %%(diary-anniversary MONTH DAY YEAR) text
                  Entry will appear on anniversary dates of MONTH DAY, YEAR.
                  (If `european-calendar-style' is t, the order of the
                  parameters should be changed to DAY, MONTH, YEAR.)  Text
                  can contain %d or %d%s; %d will be replaced by the number
                  of years since the MONTH DAY, YEAR and %s will be replaced
                  by the ordinal ending of that number (that is, `st', `nd',
                  `rd' or `th', as appropriate.  The anniversary of February
                  29 is considered to be March 1 in a non-leap year.

      %%(diary-cyclic N MONTH DAY YEAR) text
                  Entry will appear every N days, starting MONTH DAY, YEAR.
                  (If `european-calendar-style' is t, the order of the

      %%(diary-remind SEXP DAYS &optional MARKING) text
                  Entry is a reminder for diary sexp SEXP.  DAYS is either a
                  single number or a list of numbers indicating the number(s)
                  of days before the event that the warning(s) should occur.
                  If the current date is (one of) DAYS before the event
                  indicated by EXPR, then a suitable message (as specified
                  by `diary-remind-message') appears.  In addition to the
                  reminders beforehand, the diary entry also appears on
                  the date itself.  If optional MARKING is non-nil then the
                  *reminders* are marked on the calendar.  Marking of
                  reminders is independent of whether the entry *itself* is
                  a marking or nonmarking one.
