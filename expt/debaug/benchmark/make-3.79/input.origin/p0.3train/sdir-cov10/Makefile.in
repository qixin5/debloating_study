# Right now, this is not used.

# Where to install Emacs's man pages, and what extension they should have.

# Where to install and expect the info files describing Emacs.	In the

# since there are now many packages documented with the texinfo
# system, it is inappropriate to imply that it is part of Emacs.
infodir=@infodir@

# Where to look for bitmap files.
bitmapdir=@bitmapdir@

# Where to find the source code.  The source code for Emacs's C kernel is

lisppath=@lisppath@

# Where Emacs will search for its lisp files while
# building.  This is only used during the process of
# compiling Emacs, to help Emacs find its lisp files
# before they've been installed in their final location.
# It's usually identical to lisppath, except that 
# it does not include locallisppath, and the
# entry for the directory containing the installed lisp
# files has been replaced with ../lisp.  This should be a
# colon-separated list of directories.
buildlisppath=${srcdir}/lisp

# Where to install the other architecture-independent
# data files distributed with Emacs (like the tutorial,
# the cookie recipes and the Zippy database). This path
# usually contains the Emacs version number, so the data
# files for multiple versions of Emacs may be installed
# at once.
etcdir=@etcdir@

# Where to put executables to be run by Emacs rather than
# the user.  This path usually includes the Emacs version

### Unlocking and relocking.  The idea of these productions is to reduce
### hassles when installing an incremental tar of Emacs.  Do `make unlock'
### before unlocking the file to take the write locks off all sources so
### that tar xvof will overwrite them without fuss.  Then do `make relock'
### afterward so that VC mode will know which files should be checked in
### if you want to mung them.
###
### Note: it's no disaster if these productions miss a file or two; tar
### and VC will swiftly let you know if this happens, and it is easily
### corrected.
