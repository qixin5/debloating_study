This startup directory has all five .c files modified.  It also has the 
header files in a "headers" directory to test the -I. flag.  The only
difference between this directory and sdir3 is that this directory
contains a Makefile, unlike sdir3, where you have to use the -f flag to
specify a Makefile residing from outside the directory, and of course the 
headers directory.
