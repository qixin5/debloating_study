;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The funniest thing about this is that I can't imagine why a package
;; so obviously useful as this hasn't been written before!!
;; ;;; find-func
;; (find-function-setup-keys)
;;
;; or just:
;;
;; (load "find-func")
;;
;; if you don't like the given keybindings and away you go!  It does
;; pretty much what you would expect, putting the cursor at the
;; definition of the function or variable at point.
;;
;; The code started out from `describe-function', `describe-key'
;; ("help.el") and `fff-find-loaded-emacs-lisp-function' (Noah Friedman's
;; "fff.el").
