;;; (defvars, key definitions, etc.).  For example,
;;;	;;;###autoload
;;;	(defun foobar () ....)
;;;	;;;###autoload (define-key global-map "f" 'foobar)
;;;	;;;###autoload
;;;	(defvar foobar-var nil "\

;;; Then do M-x update-file-autoloads on the file to update loaddefs.el.

;;; You can also use M-x update-autoloads-from-directory to update the

The syntax of `defadvice' is as follows:

  (defadvice FUNCTION (CLASS NAME [POSITION] [ARGLIST] FLAG...)

FUNCTION ::= Name of the function to be advised.
CLASS ::= `before' | `around' | `after' | `activation' | `deactivation'.
NAME ::= Non-nil symbol that names this piece of advice.
POSITION ::= `first' | `last' | NUMBER. Optional, defaults to `first',
    see also `ad-add-advice'.
ARGLIST ::= An optional argument list to be used for the advised function
    instead of the argument list of the original.  The first one found in
    before/around/after-advices will be used.
FLAG ::= `protect'|`disable'|`activate'|`compile'|`preactivate'|`freeze'.
    All flags can be specified with unambiguous initial substrings.
DOCSTRING ::= Optional documentation for this piece of advice.
INTERACTIVE-FORM ::= Optional interactive form to be used for the advised
    function.  The first one found in before/around/after-advices will be used.
BODY ::= Any s-expression.

Semantics of the various flags:
`protect': The piece of advice will be protected against non-local exits in
any code that precedes it.  If any around-advice of a function is protected
then automatically all around-advices will be protected (the complete onion).

`activate': All advice of FUNCTION will be activated immediately if
FUNCTION has been properly defined prior to this application of `defadvice'.

`compile': In conjunction with `activate' specifies that the resulting
advised function should be compiled.

`disable': The defined advice will be disabled, hence, it will not be used 
during activation until somebody enables it.

`preactivate': Preactivates the advised FUNCTION at macro-expansion/compile
time.  This generates a compiled advised definition according to the current
advice state that will be used during activation if appropriate.  Only use
this if the `defadvice' gets actually compiled.

`freeze': Expands the `defadvice' into a redefining `defun/defmacro' according
to this particular single advice.  No other advice information will be saved.
Frozen advices cannot be undone, they behave like a hard redefinition of
the advised function.  `freeze' implies `activate' and `preactivate'.  The
documentation of the advised function can be dumped onto the `DOC' file
during preloading.

Look at the file `advice.el' for comprehensive documentation." nil (quote macro))

Major mode for editing arrays.

  Array mode is a specialized mode for editing arrays.  An array is
considered to be a two-dimensional set of strings.  The strings are
NOT recognized as integers or real numbers.

  The array MUST reside at the top of the buffer.  

  TABs are not respected, and may be converted into spaces at any time.
Setting the variable 'respect-tabs to non-nil will prevent TAB conversion,
but will cause many functions to give errors if they encounter one.

  Upon entering array mode, you will be prompted for the values of
several variables.  Others will be calculated based on the values you
supply.  These variables are all local the the buffer.  Other buffer
in array mode may have different values assigned to the variables.
The variables are:

Variables you assign:
     max-row:          The number of rows in the array.
     max-column:       The number of columns in the array. 
     columns-per-line: The number of columns in the array per line of buffer.
     field-width:      The width of each field, in characters.
     rows-numbered:    A logical variable describing whether to ignore
                       row numbers in the buffer.

Variables which are calculated:
     line-length:      The number of characters in a buffer line.
     lines-per-row:    The number of buffer lines used to display each row.

  The following commands are available (an asterisk indicates it may
take a numeric prefix argument):

    *  	\\<array-mode-map>\\[array-forward-column]	  Move forward one column.
    *  	\\[array-backward-column]	  Move backward one column.
    *  	\\[array-next-row]	  Move down one row.
    *  	\\[array-previous-row]	  Move up one row.

    *   \\[array-copy-forward]	  Copy the current field into the column to the right.
    *   \\[array-copy-backward]	  Copy the current field into the column to the left.
    *   \\[array-copy-down]	  Copy the current field into the row below.
    *   \\[array-copy-up]	  Copy the current field into the row above.

    *   \\[array-copy-column-forward]   Copy the current column into the column to the right.
    *   \\[array-copy-column-backward]   Copy the current column into the column to the left.
    *   \\[array-copy-row-down]   Copy the current row into the row below.
    *   \\[array-copy-row-up]   Copy the current row into the row above.

        \\[array-fill-rectangle]   Copy the field at mark into every cell with row and column
                  between that of point and mark.

	\\[array-what-position]	  Display the current array row and column.
	\\[array-goto-cell]	  Go to a particular array cell.

	\\[array-make-template]	  Make a template for a new array.
	\\[array-reconfigure-rows]	  Reconfigure the array.
        \\[array-expand-rows]   Expand the array (remove row numbers and
                  newlines inside rows)

        \\[array-display-local-variables]   Display the current values of local variables.

Entering array mode calls the function `array-mode-hook'." t nil)

To submit a problem report, enter \\[bibtex-submit-bug-report] from a
BibTeX mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with
version information already added.  You just need to add a description
of the problem, including a reproducable test case and send the
message.


General information on working with BibTeX mode:

You should use commands as \\[bibtex-Book] to get a template for a
specific entry. You should then fill in all desired fields using
\\[bibtex-next-field] to jump from field to field. After having filled
in all desired fields in the entry, you should clean the new entry
with command \\[bibtex-clean-entry].

Some features of BibTeX mode are available only by setting variable
bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries to t. However, then BibTeX mode will
work with buffer containing only valid (syntactical correct) entries
and with entries being sorted. This is usually the case, if you have
created a buffer completely with BibTeX mode and finished every new
entry with \\[bibtex-clean-entry].

For third party BibTeX buffers, please call the function
`bibtex-convert-alien' to fully take advantage of all features of
BibTeX mode.


Special information:

A command such as \\[bibtex-Book] will outline the fields for a BibTeX book entry.

The optional fields start with the string OPT, and are thus ignored by BibTeX.
Alternatives from which only one is required start with the string ALT.
The OPT or ALT string may be removed from a field with \\[bibtex-remove-OPT-or-ALT].
\\[bibtex-make-field] inserts a new field after the current one.
\\[bibtex-kill-field] kills the current field entirely.
\\[bibtex-yank] will yank the last recently killed field after the
current field.
\\[bibtex-remove-delimiters] removes the double-quotes or braces around the text of the current field.
 \\[bibtex-empty-field] replaces the text of the current field with the default \"\" or {}.

The command \\[bibtex-clean-entry] cleans the current entry, i.e. it removes OPT/ALT
from all non-empty optional or alternative fields, checks that no required
fields are empty, and does some formatting dependent on the value of
bibtex-entry-format.
Note: some functions in BibTeX mode depend on entries being in a special
format (all fields beginning on separate lines), so it is usually a bad
idea to remove `realign' from bibtex-entry-format.

Use \\[bibtex-find-text] to position the cursor at the end of the current field.
Use \\[bibtex-next-field] to move to end of the next field.

;;; Generated autoloads from play/blackbox.el

(autoload (quote blackbox) "blackbox" "\
Play blackbox.  Optional prefix argument is the number of balls;
the default is 4.

What is blackbox?

Blackbox is a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the
Blackbox).  Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several
balls (usually 4) within this box.  By shooting rays into the box and
observing where they emerge it is possible to deduce the positions of
the hidden balls.  The fewer rays you use to find the balls, the lower
your score.

Overview of play:

\\<blackbox-mode-map>To play blackbox, type \\[blackbox].  An optional prefix argument
specifies the number of balls to be hidden in the box; the default is
four.

The cursor can be moved around the box with the standard cursor
movement keys.

To shoot a ray, move the cursor to the edge of the box and press SPC.
The result will be determined and the playfield updated.

You may place or remove balls in the box by moving the cursor into the
box and pressing \\[bb-romp].

When you think the configuration of balls you have placed is correct,
press \\[bb-done].  You will be informed whether you are correct or
not, and be given your score.  Your score is the number of letters and
numbers around the outside of the box plus five for each incorrectly
placed ball.  If you placed any balls incorrectly, they will be
indicated with `x', and their actual positions indicated with `o'.

Details:

There are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:

	Detour: the ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than
		where you sent it in.  On the playfield, detours are
		denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the
		ray went in, and the other where it came out.

	Reflection: the ray is reflected and emerges in the same place
		it was sent in.  On the playfield, reflections are
		denoted by the letter `R'.

	Hit:	the ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed.  It does
		not emerge from the box.  On the playfield, hits are
		denoted by the letter `H'.

The rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by
example.

As a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees.  Rays can
be deflected multiple times.  In the diagrams below, the dashes
represent empty box locations and the letter `O' represents a ball.
The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers as
described under \"Detour\" above.  Note that the entrance and exit
points are always interchangeable.  `*' denotes the path taken by the
ray.

Note carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety
degree deflection it causes.

                                2                         3

As mentioned above, a reflection occurs when a ray emerges from the same point
it was sent in.  This can happen in several ways:

                                                                           
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - O - O - - -          - - - - - - - -
R * * * * - - - -         - - - * - - - -          O - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - - * - - - -        R - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       R * * * * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - - - - - -

In the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper
ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to
its point of origin.  The second example is similar.  The third
example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the
ray never gets a chance to get into the box.  Alternatively, the ray
can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately
emerging from the box.

A hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -        H * * * * - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       H * * * * O - - -          - - - * - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - O - - - -
H * * * O - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -

Be sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of
a reflection." t nil)

            MONTHNAME DAY
            MONTHNAME DAY, YEAR
            DAYNAME

at the beginning of the line; the remainder of the line is the diary entry
string for that date.  MONTH and DAY are one or two digit numbers, YEAR is
a number and may be written in full or abbreviated to the final two digits.
If the date does not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any year.
DAYNAME entries apply to any date on which is on that day of the week.
MONTHNAME and DAYNAME can be spelled in full, abbreviated to three
characters (with or without a period), capitalized or not.  Any of DAY,
MONTH, or MONTHNAME, YEAR can be `*' which matches any day, month, or year,
respectively.

The European style (in which the day precedes the month) can be used
instead, if you execute `european-calendar' when in the calendar, or set
`european-calendar-style' to t in your .emacs file.  The European forms are

            DAY/MONTH
            DAY/MONTH/YEAR
            DAY MONTHNAME
            DAY MONTHNAME YEAR
            DAYNAME

To revert to the default American style from the European style, execute
`american-calendar' in the calendar.

A diary entry can be preceded by the character
`diary-nonmarking-symbol' (ordinarily `&') to make that entry
nonmarking--that is, it will not be marked on dates in the calendar
window but will appear in a diary window.

Multiline diary entries are made by indenting lines after the first with
either a TAB or one or more spaces.

Lines not in one the above formats are ignored.  Here are some sample diary
entries (in the default American style):

     12/22/1988 Twentieth wedding anniversary!!
     &1/1. Happy New Year!
     10/22 Ruth's birthday.
     21: Payday
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
              Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
     1/13/89 Friday the thirteenth!!
     &thu 4pm squash game with Lloyd.
     mar 16 Dad's birthday
     April 15, 1989 Income tax due.
     &* 15 time cards due.

If the first line of a diary entry consists only of the date or day name with
no trailing blanks or punctuation, then that line is not displayed in the
diary window; only the continuation lines is shown.  For example, the
single diary entry

     02/11/1989
      Bill Blattner visits Princeton today
      2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
      2:30-5:30 Lizzie at Lawrenceville for `Group Initiative'
      4:00pm Jamie Tappenden
      7:30pm Dinner at George and Ed's for Alan Ryan
      7:30-10:00pm dance at Stewart Country Day School

will appear in the diary window without the date line at the beginning.  This
facility allows the diary window to look neater, but can cause confusion if
used with more than one day's entries displayed.

Diary entries can be based on Lisp sexps.  For example, the diary entry

      %%(diary-block 11 1 1990 11 10 1990) Vacation

causes the diary entry \"Vacation\" to appear from November 1 through November
10, 1990.  Other functions available are `diary-float', `diary-anniversary',
`diary-cyclic', `diary-day-of-year', `diary-iso-date', `diary-french-date',
`diary-hebrew-date', `diary-islamic-date', `diary-mayan-date',

`diary-phases-of-moon', `diary-parasha', `diary-omer', `diary-rosh-hodesh',
and `diary-sabbath-candles'.  See the documentation for the function
`list-sexp-diary-entries' for more details.

possible, but because these are somewhat slow, they are ignored
unless you set the `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook' and the
`nongregorian-diary-marking-hook' appropriately.  See the documentation

(autoload (quote cperl-mode) "cperl-mode" "\
Major mode for editing Perl code.
Expression and list commands understand all C brackets.
Tab indents for Perl code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Various characters in Perl almost always come in pairs: {}, (), [],
sometimes <>.  When the user types the first, she gets the second as
well, with optional special formatting done on {}.  (Disabled by
default.)  You can always quote (with \\[quoted-insert]) the left
\"paren\" to avoid the expansion.  The processing of < is special,
since most the time you mean \"less\".  Cperl mode tries to guess
whether you want to type pair <>, and inserts is if it
appropriate.  You can set `cperl-electric-parens-string' to the string that
contains the parenths from the above list you want to be electrical.
Electricity of parenths is controlled by `cperl-electric-parens'.
You may also set `cperl-electric-parens-mark' to have electric parens
look for active mark and \"embrace\" a region if possible.'

CPerl mode provides expansion of the Perl control constructs:

   if, else, elsif, unless, while, until, continue, do, 
   for, foreach, formy and foreachmy.

and POD directives (Disabled by default, see `cperl-electric-keywords'.)

The user types the keyword immediately followed by a space, which
causes the construct to be expanded, and the point is positioned where
she is most likely to want to be.  eg. when the user types a space
following \"if\" the following appears in the buffer: if () { or if ()
} { } and the cursor is between the parentheses.  The user can then
type some boolean expression within the parens.  Having done that,
typing \\[cperl-linefeed] places you - appropriately indented - on a
new line between the braces (if you typed \\[cperl-linefeed] in a POD
directive line, then appropriate number of new lines is inserted).  

If CPerl decides that you want to insert \"English\" style construct like

            bite if angry;

it will not do any expansion.  See also help on variable
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'.  (Note that one can switch the
help message on expansion by setting `cperl-message-electric-keyword'
to nil.)

\\[cperl-linefeed] is a convenience replacement for typing carriage
return.  It places you in the next line with proper indentation, or if
you type it inside the inline block of control construct, like

            foreach (@lines) {print; print}

and you are on a boundary of a statement inside braces, it will
transform the construct into a multiline and will place you into an
appropriately indented blank line.  If you need a usual 
`newline-and-indent' behaviour, it is on \\[newline-and-indent], 
see documentation on `cperl-electric-linefeed'.

Use \\[cperl-invert-if-unless] to change a construction of the form

	    if (A) { B }

into

            B if A;

\\{cperl-mode-map}

Setting the variable `cperl-font-lock' to t switches on font-lock-mode
\(even with older Emacsen), `cperl-electric-lbrace-space' to t switches
on electric space between $ and {, `cperl-electric-parens-string' is
the string that contains parentheses that should be electric in CPerl
\(see also `cperl-electric-parens-mark' and `cperl-electric-parens'),
setting `cperl-electric-keywords' enables electric expansion of
control structures in CPerl.  `cperl-electric-linefeed' governs which
one of two linefeed behavior is preferable.  You can enable all these
options simultaneously (recommended mode of use) by setting
`cperl-hairy' to t.  In this case you can switch separate options off
by setting them to `null'.  Note that one may undo the extra
whitespace inserted by semis and braces in `auto-newline'-mode by
consequent \\[cperl-electric-backspace].

If your site has perl5 documentation in info format, you can use commands
\\[cperl-info-on-current-command] and \\[cperl-info-on-command] to access it.
These keys run commands `cperl-info-on-current-command' and
`cperl-info-on-command', which one is which is controlled by variable
`cperl-info-on-command-no-prompt' and `cperl-clobber-lisp-bindings' 
\(in turn affected by `cperl-hairy').

Even if you have no info-format documentation, short one-liner-style
help is available on \\[cperl-get-help], and one can run perldoc or
man via menu.

It is possible to show this help automatically after some idle time.
This is regulated by variable `cperl-lazy-help-time'.  Default with
`cperl-hairy' (if the value of `cperl-lazy-help-time' is nil) is 5
secs idle time .  It is also possible to switch this on/off from the
menu, or via \\[cperl-toggle-autohelp].  Requires `run-with-idle-timer'.

Use \\[cperl-lineup] to vertically lineup some construction - put the
beginning of the region at the start of construction, and make region
span the needed amount of lines.

Variables `cperl-pod-here-scan', `cperl-pod-here-fontify',
`cperl-pod-face', `cperl-pod-head-face' control processing of pod and
here-docs sections.  With capable Emaxen results of scan are used
for indentation too, otherwise they are used for highlighting only.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `cperl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in CPerl mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `cperl-indent-left-aligned-comments'
    Non-nil means that the comment starting in leftmost column should indent.
 `cperl-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces,
    and after colons and semicolons, inserted in Perl code.  The following
    \\[cperl-electric-backspace] will remove the inserted whitespace.
    Insertion after colons requires both this variable and 
    `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon' set. 
 `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon'
    Non-nil means automatically newline even after colons.
    Subject to `cperl-auto-newline' setting.
 `cperl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `cperl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if, or body of a while, or just a statement continuation.
 `cperl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `cperl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `cperl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `cperl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it the line started
    this far to the right of the actual line indentation.
 `cperl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `cperl-min-label-indent'
    Minimal indentation for line that is a label.

Settings for K&R and BSD indentation styles are
  `cperl-indent-level'                5    8
  `cperl-continued-statement-offset'  5    8
  `cperl-brace-offset'               -5   -8
  `cperl-label-offset'               -5   -8

CPerl knows several indentation styles, and may bulk set the
corresponding variables.  Use \\[cperl-set-style] to do this.  Use
\\[cperl-set-style-back] to restore the memorized preexisting values
\(both available from menu).

If `cperl-indent-level' is 0, the statement after opening brace in
column 0 is indented on 
`cperl-brace-offset'+`cperl-continued-statement-offset'.

Turning on CPerl mode calls the hooks in the variable `cperl-mode-hook'
with no args.

DO NOT FORGET to read micro-docs (available from `Perl' menu)
or as help on variables `cperl-tips', `cperl-problems',
`cperl-non-problems', `cperl-praise', `cperl-speed'." t nil)

Variables controlling indentation style and extra features:

 dcl-basic-offset
    Extra indentation within blocks.

 dcl-continuation-offset
    Extra indentation for continued lines.

 dcl-margin-offset
    Indentation for the first command line in a file or SUBROUTINE.

 dcl-margin-label-offset
    Indentation for a label.

 dcl-comment-line-regexp
    Lines matching this regexp will not be indented.

 dcl-block-end-regexp
    Regexps that match command lines that begin and end, respectively,
    a block of commmand lines that will be given extra indentation.

    Two such functions are included in the package:
	dcl-calc-command-indent-multiple
	dcl-calc-command-indent-hang

 dcl-calc-cont-indent-function
    Can be set to a function that customizes indentation for continued lines.
    One such function is included in the package:
	dcl-calc-cont-indent-relative    (set by default)

 dcl-tab-always-indent
    If t, pressing TAB always indents the current line.
    If nil, pressing TAB indents the current line if point is at the left 
    margin.

 dcl-electric-characters 
    Non-nil causes lines to be indented at once when a label, ELSE or ENDIF is
    typed.

 dcl-electric-reindent-regexps
    Use this variable and function dcl-electric-character to customize
    which words trigger electric indentation.

 dcl-tempo-comma
 dcl-tempo-left-paren
 dcl-tempo-right-paren
    These variables control the look of expanded templates.

 dcl-imenu-generic-expression
    Default value for imenu-generic-expression.  The default includes
    SUBROUTINE labels in the main listing and sub-listings for
    other labels, CALL, GOTO and GOSUB statements. 

 dcl-imenu-label-labels
 dcl-imenu-label-goto
 dcl-imenu-label-gosub
 dcl-imenu-label-call
    Change the text that is used as sub-listing labels in imenu.

Loading this package calls the value of the variable
`dcl-mode-load-hook' with no args, if that value is non-nil. 
Turning on DCL mode calls the value of the variable `dcl-mode-hook'

Define a menu bar submenu in maps MAPS, according to MENU.
The menu keymap is stored in symbol SYMBOL, both as its value

The first element of MENU must be a string.  It is the menu bar item name.
It may be followed by the following keyword argument pairs

   :filter FUNCTION

FUNCTION is a function with one argument, the menu.  It returns the actual
menu displayed.

   :visible INCLUDE

INCLUDE is an expression; this menu is only visible if this
expression has a non-nil value.  `:include' is an alias for `:visible'.

   :active ENABLE

ENABLE is an expression; the menu is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

The rest of the elements in MENU, are menu items.

A menu item is usually a vector of three elements:  [NAME CALLBACK ENABLE]

NAME is a string--the menu item name.

CALLBACK is a command to run when the item is chosen,
or a list to evaluate when the item is chosen.

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

Alternatively, a menu item may have the form: 

   [ NAME CALLBACK [ KEYWORD ARG ] ... ]

Where KEYWORD is one of the symbols defined below.

   :keys KEYS

KEYS is a string; a complex keyboard equivalent to this menu item.
This is normally not needed because keyboard equivalents are usually
computed automatically.
KEYS is expanded with `substitute-command-keys' before it is used.

   :key-sequence KEYS

KEYS is nil a string or a vector; nil or a keyboard equivalent to this
menu item.
This is a hint that will considerably speed up Emacs first display of
a menu.  Use `:key-sequence nil' when you know that this menu item has no
keyboard equivalent.

   :active ENABLE

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

   :included INCLUDE

INCLUDE is an expression; this item is only visible if this
expression has a non-nil value.

   :suffix NAME

NAME is a string; the name of an argument to CALLBACK.

   :style STYLE
   
STYLE is a symbol describing the type of menu item.  The following are
defined:  

toggle: A checkbox.
        Prepend the name with `(*) ' or `( ) ' depending on if selected or not.
radio: A radio button.
       Prepend the name with `[X] ' or `[ ] ' depending on if selected or not.
button: Surround the name with `[' and `]'. Use this for an item in the
        menu bar itself.
anything else means an ordinary menu item.

   :selected SELECTED

SELECTED is an expression; the checkbox or radio button is selected
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

A menu item can be a string.  Then that string appears in the menu as
unselectable text.  A string consisting solely of hyphens is displayed
as a solid horizontal line.

A menu item can be a list with the same format as MENU.  This is a submenu." nil (quote macro))

Minor mode that combines windows into one tall virtual window.

The feeling of a \"virtual window\" has been accomplished by the use
of two major techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow Mode.)

* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two
side-by-side window are used. The user can, with the help of Follow
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
one. Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`\\[split-window-horizontally]' or `M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each-other.

If the variable `follow-intercept-processes' is non-nil, Follow mode
will listen to the output of processes and redisplay accordingly.
\(This is the default.)

When Follow mode is switched on, the hook `follow-mode-hook'
is called.  When turned off, `follow-mode-off-hook' is called.

two windows always will display two successive pages.
\(If one window is moved, the other one will follow.)

If ARG is positive, the leftmost window is selected.  If it negative,
the rightmost is selected.  If ARG is nil, the leftmost window is
selected if the original window is the first one in the frame.

 - Strings are displayed in `font-lock-string-face';
 - Certain other expressions are displayed in other faces according to the
   value of the variable `font-lock-keywords'.

You can enable Font Lock mode in any major mode automatically by turning on in
the major mode's hook.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)

Alternatively, you can use Global Font Lock mode to automagically turn on Font
Lock mode in buffers whose major mode supports it and whose major mode is one
of `font-lock-global-modes'.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (global-font-lock-mode t)

There are a number of support modes that may be used to speed up Font Lock mode
in various ways, specified via the variable `font-lock-support-mode'.  Where
major modes support different levels of fontification, you can use the variable
`font-lock-maximum-decoration' to specify which level you generally prefer.
When you turn Font Lock mode on/off the buffer is fontified/defontified, though
fontification occurs only if the buffer is less than `font-lock-maximum-size'.

For example, to specify that Font Lock mode use use Lazy Lock mode as a support
mode and use maximum levels of fontification, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (setq font-lock-support-mode 'lazy-lock-mode)
 (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)

To add your own highlighting for some major mode, and modify the highlighting
selected automatically via the variable `font-lock-maximum-decoration', you can
use `font-lock-add-keywords'.

To fontify a buffer, without turning on Font Lock mode and regardless of buffer
size, you can use \\[font-lock-fontify-buffer].

To fontify a block (the function or paragraph containing point, or a number of
lines around point), perhaps because modification on the current line caused
syntactic change on other lines, you can use \\[font-lock-fontify-block].

\\<hexl-mode-map>
A major mode for editing binary files in hex dump format.

This function automatically converts a buffer into the hexl format
using the function `hexlify-buffer'.

Each line in the buffer has an \"address\" (displayed in hexadecimal)
representing the offset into the file that the characters on this line
are at and 16 characters from the file (displayed as hexadecimal
values grouped every 16 bits) and as their ASCII values.

If any of the characters (displayed as ASCII characters) are
unprintable (control or meta characters) they will be replaced as
periods.

If `hexl-mode' is invoked with an argument the buffer is assumed to be
in hexl format.

Movement is as simple as movement in a normal emacs text buffer.  Most
cursor movement bindings are the same (ie. Use \\[hexl-backward-char], \\[hexl-forward-char], \\[hexl-next-line], and \\[hexl-previous-line]
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up).

Advanced cursor movement commands (ala \\[hexl-beginning-of-line], \\[hexl-end-of-line], \\[hexl-beginning-of-buffer], and \\[hexl-end-of-buffer]) are
also supported.

There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:

ASCII characters (character between space (0x20) and tilde (0x7E)) are
bound to self-insert so you can simply type the character and it will
insert itself (actually overstrike) into the buffer.

\\[hexl-quoted-insert] followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.

\\[hexl-insert-hex-char] will insert a given hexadecimal value (if it is between 0 and 0xFF)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-octal-char] will insert a given octal value (if it is between 0 and 0377)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-decimal-char] will insert a given decimal value (if it is between 0 and 255)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-mode-exit] will exit hexl-mode.

Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.

You can use \\[hexl-find-file] to visit a file in hexl-mode.

An alist of dictionaries and their associated parameters.

Each element of this list is also a list:

\(DICTIONARY-NAME CASECHARS NOT-CASECHARS OTHERCHARS MANY-OTHERCHARS-P
        ISPELL-ARGS EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE CHARACTER-SET)

DICTIONARY-NAME is a possible string value of variable `ispell-dictionary',
nil means the default dictionary.

CASECHARS is a regular expression of valid characters that comprise a
word.

NOT-CASECHARS is the opposite regexp of CASECHARS.

OTHERCHARS is a regexp of characters in the NOT-CASECHARS set but which can be
used to construct words in some special way.  If OTHERCHARS characters follow
and precede characters from CASECHARS, they are parsed as part of a word,
otherwise they become word-breaks.  As an example in English, assume the
regular expression \"[']\" for OTHERCHARS.  Then \"they're\" and
\"Steven's\" are parsed as single words including the \"'\" character, but
\"Stevens'\" does not include the quote character as part of the word.
If you want OTHERCHARS to be empty, use the empty string.
Hint: regexp syntax requires the hyphen to be declared first here.

MANY-OTHERCHARS-P is non-nil when multiple OTHERCHARS are allowed in a word.
Otherwise only a single OTHERCHARS character is allowed to be part of any
single word.

ISPELL-ARGS is a list of additional arguments passed to the ispell
subprocess.

EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE should be used when dictionaries are used which
have been configured in an Ispell affix file.  (For example, umlauts
can be encoded as \\\"a, a\\\", \"a, ...)  Defaults are ~tex and ~nroff
in English.  This has the same effect as the command-line `-T' option.
The buffer Major Mode controls Ispell's parsing in tex or nroff mode,
but the dictionary can control the extended character mode.
Both defaults can be overruled in a buffer-local fashion. See
`ispell-parsing-keyword' for details on this.

CHARACTER-SET used for languages with multibyte characters.

Note that the CASECHARS and OTHERCHARS slots of the alist should
contain the same character set as casechars and otherchars in the
LANGUAGE.aff file (e.g., english.aff).")

(autoload (quote lazy-lock-mode) "lazy-lock" "\
Toggle Lazy Lock mode.
With arg, turn Lazy Lock mode on if and only if arg is positive.  Enable it
automatically in your `~/.emacs' by:

 (setq font-lock-support-mode 'lazy-lock-mode)

When Lazy Lock mode is enabled, fontification can be lazy in a number of ways:

- Demand-driven buffer fontification if `lazy-lock-minimum-size' is non-nil.
  This means initial fontification does not occur if the buffer is greater than
  `lazy-lock-minimum-size' characters in length.  Instead, fontification occurs
  when necessary, such as when scrolling through the buffer would otherwise
  reveal unfontified areas.  This is useful if buffer fontification is too slow
  for large buffers.

- Deferred scroll fontification if `lazy-lock-defer-on-scrolling' is non-nil.
  This means demand-driven fontification does not occur as you scroll.
  Instead, fontification is deferred until after `lazy-lock-defer-time' seconds
  of Emacs idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  This is useful if
  fontification is too slow to keep up with scrolling.

- Deferred on-the-fly fontification if `lazy-lock-defer-on-the-fly' is non-nil.
  This means on-the-fly fontification does not occur as you type.  Instead,
  fontification is deferred until after `lazy-lock-defer-time' seconds of Emacs
  idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  This is useful if fontification is too
  slow to keep up with your typing.

- Deferred context fontification if `lazy-lock-defer-contextually' is non-nil.
  This means fontification updates the buffer corresponding to true syntactic
  context, after `lazy-lock-defer-time' seconds of Emacs idle time, while Emacs
  remains idle.  Otherwise, fontification occurs on modified lines only, and
  subsequent lines can remain fontified corresponding to previous syntactic
  contexts.  This is useful where strings or comments span lines.

- Stealthy buffer fontification if `lazy-lock-stealth-time' is non-nil.
  This means remaining unfontified areas of buffers are fontified if Emacs has
  been idle for `lazy-lock-stealth-time' seconds, while Emacs remains idle.
  This is useful if any buffer has any deferred fontification.

Basic Font Lock mode on-the-fly fontification behaviour fontifies modified
lines only.  Thus, if `lazy-lock-defer-contextually' is non-nil, Lazy Lock mode
on-the-fly fontification may fontify differently, albeit correctly.  In any
event, to refontify some lines you can use \\[font-lock-fontify-block].

Stealth fontification only occurs while the system remains unloaded.
If the system load rises above `lazy-lock-stealth-load' percent, stealth
fontification is suspended.  Stealth fontification intensity is controlled via
the variable `lazy-lock-stealth-nice' and `lazy-lock-stealth-lines', and
verbosity is controlled via the variable `lazy-lock-stealth-verbose'." t nil)

This mode makes it easier to write Octave code by helping with
indentation, doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev mode) and by
showing keywords, comments, strings, etc. in different faces (with
Font Lock mode on terminals that support it).

Octave itself is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.  Function definitions
can also be stored in files, and it can be used in a batch mode (which
is why you need this mode!).

The latest released version of Octave is always available via anonymous
ftp from bevo.che.wisc.edu in the directory `/pub/octave'.  Complete
source and binaries for several popular systems are available.

Keybindings
===========

\\{octave-mode-map}

Variables you can use to customize Octave mode
==============================================

octave-auto-indent
  Non-nil means indent current line after a semicolon or space.
  Default is nil.

octave-auto-newline
  Non-nil means auto-insert a newline and indent after a semicolon.
  Default is nil.

octave-blink-matching-block
  Non-nil means show matching begin of block when inserting a space,
  newline or semicolon after an else or end keyword.  Default is t.

octave-block-offset
  Extra indentation applied to statements in block structures.
  Default is 2.

octave-continuation-offset
  Extra indentation applied to Octave continuation lines.
  Default is 4.

octave-continuation-string
  String used for Octave continuation lines.
  Default is a backslash.

octave-mode-startup-message
  Nil means do not display the Octave mode startup message.
  Default is t.

octave-send-echo-input
  Non-nil means always display `inferior-octave-buffer' after sending a
  command to the inferior Octave process.

octave-send-line-auto-forward
  Non-nil means always go to the next unsent line of Octave code after
  sending a line to the inferior Octave process.

octave-send-echo-input
  Non-nil means echo input sent to the inferior Octave process.

Turning on Octave mode runs the hook `octave-mode-hook'.

To begin using this mode for all `.m' files that you edit, add the
following lines to your `.emacs' file:

  (autoload 'octave-mode \"octave-mod\" nil t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (cons '(\"\\\\.m$\" . octave-mode) auto-mode-alist))

To automatically turn on the abbrev, auto-fill and font-lock features,
add the following lines to your `.emacs' file as well:

  (add-hook 'octave-mode-hook
	    (lambda ()
	      (abbrev-mode 1)
	      (auto-fill-mode 1)
	      (if (eq window-system 'x)
		  (font-lock-mode 1))))

 FORGET-LAST-SELECTION, DETERMINISTIC, KBD-TRANSLATE, SHOW-LAYOUT,
 CREATE-DECODE-MAP, MAXIMUM-SHORTEST, OVERLAY-PLIST,
 UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION, CONVERSION-KEYS and SIMPLE.

GUIDANCE specifies how a guidance string is shown in echo area.
If it is t, list of all possible translations for the current key is shown
 with the currently selected translation being highlighted.
If it is an alist, the element has the form (CHAR . STRING).  Each character
 in the current key is searched in the list and the corresponding string is
 shown.
If it is nil, the current key is shown.

DOCSTRING is the documentation string of this package.

TRANSLATION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while translation
region is active.  It is an alist of single key character vs. corresponding
command to be called.

FORGET-LAST-SELECTION non-nil means a selected translation is not kept
for the future to translate the same key.  If this flag is nil, a
translation selected for a key is remembered so that it can be the
first candidate when the same key is entered later.

DETERMINISTIC non-nil means the first candidate of translation is
selected automatically without allowing users to select another
translation for a key.  In this case, unselected translations are of
no use for an interactive use of Quail but can be used by some other
programs.  If this flag is non-nil, FORGET-LAST-SELECTION is also set
to t.

KBD-TRANSLATE non-nil means input characters are translated from a
user's keyboard layout to the standard keyboard layout.  See the
documentation of `quail-keyboard-layout' and
`quail-keyboard-layout-standard' for more detail.

SHOW-LAYOUT non-nil means the `quail-help' command should show
the user's keyboard layout visually with translated characters.
If KBD-TRANSLATE is set, it is desirable to set also this flag unless
this package defines no translations for single character keys.

CREATE-DECODE-MAP non-nil means decode map is also created.  A decode
map is an alist of translations and corresponding original keys.
Although this map is not used by Quail itself, it can be used by some
other programs.  For instance, Vietnamese supporting needs this map to
convert Vietnamese text to VIQR format which uses only ASCII
characters to represent Vietnamese characters.

MAXIMUM-SHORTEST non-nil means break key sequence to get maximum
length of the shortest sequence.  When we don't have a translation of
key \"..ABCD\" but have translations of \"..AB\" and \"CD..\", break
the key at \"..AB\" and start translation of \"CD..\".  Hangul
packages, for instance, use this facility.  If this flag is nil, we
break the key just at \"..ABC\" and start translation of \"D..\".

OVERLAY-PLIST if non-nil is a property list put on an overlay which
covers Quail translation region.

UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function to call to update
the current translation region according to a new translation data.  By
default, a translated text or a user's key sequence (if no translation
for it) is inserted.

CONVERSION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while
conversion region is active.  It is an alist of single key character
vs. corresponding command to be called.

To write fairly well formatted pages you only need to know few things.  Most
browsers have a function to read the source code of the page being seen, so
you can imitate various tricks.  Here's a very short HTML primer which you
can also view with a browser to see what happens:

<title>A Title Describing Contents</title> should be on every page.  Pages can
have <h1>Very Major Headlines</h1> through <h6>Very Minor Headlines</h6>
<hr> Parts can be separated with horizontal rules.

<p>Paragraphs only need an opening tag.  Line breaks and multiple spaces are
ignored unless the text is <pre>preformatted.</pre>  Text can be marked as
<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u> using the normal  M-g  or
Edit/Text Properties/Face commands.

Pages can have <a name=\"SOMENAME\">named points</a> and can link other points
to them with <a href=\"#SOMENAME\">see also somename</a>.  In the same way <a
href=\"URL\">see also URL</a> where URL is a filename relative to current
directory, or absolute as in `http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.

Images in many formats can be inlined with <img src=\"URL\">.

If you mainly create your own documents, `sgml-specials' might be
interesting.  But note that some HTML 2 browsers can't handle `&apos;'.

Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.

This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.

The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:

\\[sh-case]	 case statement
\\[sh-for]	 for loop
\\[sh-function]	 function definition
\\[sh-if]	 if statement
\\[sh-indexed-loop]	 indexed loop from 1 to n
\\[sh-while-getopts]	 while getopts loop
\\[sh-repeat]	 repeat loop
\\[sh-select]	 select loop
\\[sh-until]	 until loop
\\[sh-while]	 while loop

\\[backward-delete-char-untabify]	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
\\[sh-newline-and-indent]	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.
\\[sh-end-of-command]	 Go to end of successive commands.
\\[sh-beginning-of-command]	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
\\[sh-set-shell]	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
\\[sh-execute-region]	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.

\\[sh-maybe-here-document]	 Without prefix, following an unquoted < inserts here document.
{, (, [, ', \", `
	Unless quoted with \\, insert the pairs {}, (), [], or '', \"\", ``.

If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly

(autoload (quote list-load-path-shadows) "shadow" "\
Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files.

This function lists potential load-path problems.  Directories in the
`load-path' variable are searched, in order, for Emacs Lisp
files.  When a previously encountered file name is found again, a
message is displayed indicating that the later file is \"hidden\" by
the earlier.

For example, suppose `load-path' is set to

\(\"/usr/gnu/emacs/site-lisp\" \"/usr/gnu/emacs/share/emacs/19.30/lisp\")

and that each of these directories contains a file called XXX.el.  Then
XXX.el in the site-lisp directory is referred to by all of:
\(require 'XXX), (autoload .... \"XXX\"), (load-library \"XXX\") etc.

The first XXX.el file prevents emacs from seeing the second (unless
the second is loaded explicitly via load-file).

When not intended, such shadowings can be the source of subtle
problems.  For example, the above situation may have arisen because the
XXX package was not distributed with versions of emacs prior to
19.30.  An emacs maintainer downloaded XXX from elsewhere and installed
it.  Later, XXX was updated and included in the emacs distribution.
Unless the emacs maintainer checks for this, the new version of XXX
will be hidden behind the old (which may no longer work with the new
emacs version).

This function performs these checks and flags all possible
shadowings.  Because a .el file may exist without a corresponding .elc
\(or vice-versa), these suffixes are essentially ignored.  A file
XXX.elc in an early directory (that does not contain XXX.el) is
considered to shadow a later file XXX.el, and vice-versa.

When run interactively, the shadowings (if any) are displayed in a
buffer called `*Shadows*'.  Shadowings are located by calling the
\(non-interactive) companion function, `find-emacs-lisp-shadows'." t nil)

Further elements can be defined via `skeleton-further-elements'.  ELEMENT may
itself be a SKELETON with an INTERACTOR.  The user is prompted repeatedly for
different inputs.  The SKELETON is processed as often as the user enters a
non-empty string.  \\[keyboard-quit] terminates skeleton insertion, but
continues after `resume:' and positions at `_' if any.  If INTERACTOR in such
a subskeleton is a prompt-string which contains a \".. %s ..\" it is
formatted with `skeleton-subprompt'.  Such an INTERACTOR may also be a list of
strings with the subskeleton being repeated once for each string.

Quoted Lisp expressions are evaluated for their side-effects.
Other Lisp expressions are evaluated and the value treated as above.
Note that expressions may not return `t' since this implies an
endless loop.  Modes can define other symbols by locally setting them
to any valid skeleton element.  The following local variables are
available:

	str	first time: read a string according to INTERACTOR
		then: insert previously read string once more
	help	help-form during interaction with the user or `nil'
	input	initial input (string or cons with index) while reading str

What is Solitaire?

I don't know who invented this game, but it seems to be rather old and
its origin seems to be northern Africa.  Here's how to play:
Initially, the board will look similar to this:

	Le Solitaire             
	============             
	
		o   o   o        
	
		o   o   o        
	
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o
	
	o   o   o   .   o   o   o
	
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o
	
		o   o   o        
	
		o   o   o        

Let's call the o's stones and the .'s holes.  One stone fits into one
hole.  As you can see, all holes but one are occupied by stones.  The
aim of the game is to get rid of all but one stone, leaving that last
one in the middle of the board if you're cool.

A stone can be moved if there is another stone next to it, and a hole
after that one.  Thus there must be three fields in a row, either
horizontally or vertically, up, down, left or right, which look like
this:  o  o  .

Then the first stone is moved to the hole, jumping over the second,
which therefore is taken away.  The above thus `evaluates' to:  .  .  o

That's all.  Here's the board after two moves:

		o   o   o        
	
		.   o   o        
	
	o   o   .   o   o   o   o
	
	o   .   o   o   o   o   o
	
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

General text sorting routine to divide buffer into records and sort them.
Arguments are REVERSE NEXTRECFUN ENDRECFUN &optional STARTKEYFUN ENDKEYFUN.

called sort records.  A portion of each sort record (perhaps all of
it) is designated as the sort key.  The records are rearranged in the
buffer in order by their sort keys.  The records may or may not be
contiguous.

Usually the records are rearranged in order of ascending sort key.
If REVERSE is non-nil, they are rearranged in order of descending sort key.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.

The next four arguments are functions to be called to move point
across a sort record.  They will be called many times from within sort-subr.

NEXTRECFUN is called with point at the end of the previous record.

The first record is assumed to start at the position of point when sort-subr
is called.

ENDRECFUN is called with point within the record.
It should move point to the end of the record.

STARTKEYFUN moves from the start of the record to the start of the key.
It may return either a non-nil value to be used as the key, or
else the key is the substring between the values of point after
STARTKEYFUN and ENDKEYFUN are called.  If STARTKEYFUN is nil, the key
starts at the beginning of the record.

But we urge you to choose a free implementation instead of these.

Once you have the SQLi buffer, you can enter SQL statements in the

Major mode for editing Texinfo files.

  It has these extra commands:
\\{texinfo-mode-map}

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with \\[makeinfo-buffer] or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.

  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use \\[makeinfo-region], which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.

  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with \\[texinfo-show-structure].
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use \\[occur-mode-goto-occurrence], to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.

  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
\\[texinfo-insert-braces] and later use the command \\[up-list] to
move forward past the closing brace.

Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions

  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

    texinfo-every-node-update          \\[texinfo-every-node-update]

    texinfo-master-menu

    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)

The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.

Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.

To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.

(autoload (quote type-break-mode) "type-break" "\
Enable or disable typing-break mode.
This is a minor mode, but it is global to all buffers by default.

When this mode is enabled, the user is encouraged to take typing breaks at
appropriate intervals; either after a specified amount of time or when the
user has exceeded a keystroke threshold.  When the time arrives, the user
is asked to take a break.  If the user refuses at that time, emacs will ask
again in a short period of time.  The idea is to give the user enough time
to find a good breaking point in his or her work, but be sufficiently
annoying to discourage putting typing breaks off indefinitely.

A negative prefix argument disables this mode.
No argument or any non-negative argument enables it.

The user may enable or disable this mode by setting the variable of the
same name, though setting it in that way doesn't reschedule a break or
reset the keystroke counter.

If the mode was previously disabled and is enabled as a consequence of
calling this function, it schedules a break with `type-break-schedule' to
make sure one occurs (the user can call that command to reschedule the
break at any time).  It also initializes the keystroke counter.

The variable `type-break-interval' specifies the number of seconds to
schedule between regular typing breaks.  This variable doesn't directly
affect the time schedule; it simply provides a default for the
`type-break-schedule' command.

If set, the variable `type-break-good-rest-interval' specifies the minimum
amount of time which is considered a reasonable typing break.  Whenever
that time has elapsed, typing breaks are automatically rescheduled for
later even if emacs didn't prompt you to take one first.  Also, if a break
is ended before this much time has elapsed, the user will be asked whether
or not to continue.

The variable `type-break-keystroke-threshold' is used to determine the
thresholds at which typing breaks should be considered.  You can use
the command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' to try to
approximate good values for this.

There are several variables that affect how or when warning messages about
imminent typing breaks are displayed.  They include:

        `type-break-mode-line-message-mode'
        `type-break-time-warning-intervals'

        `type-break-warning-countdown-string'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string-type'

a typing break occur.  They include:

        `type-break-query-mode'
        `type-break-query-function'
        `type-break-query-interval'

Guess values for the minimum/maximum keystroke threshold for typing breaks.

If called interactively, the user is prompted for their guess as to how
many words per minute they usually type.  This value should not be your
maximum WPM, but your average.  Of course, this is harder to gauge since it
can vary considerably depending on what you are doing.  For example, one
tends to type less when debugging a program as opposed to writing
documentation.  (Perhaps a separate program should be written to estimate
average typing speed.)

From that, this command sets the values in `type-break-keystroke-threshold'
based on a fairly simple algorithm involving assumptions about the average
length of words (5).  For the minimum threshold, it uses about a fifth of
the computed maximum threshold.

When called from lisp programs, the optional args WORDLEN and FRAC can be
used to override the default assumption about average word length and the
fraction of the maximum threshold to which to set the minimum threshold.
FRAC should be the inverse of the fractional value; for example, a value of
2 would mean to use one half, a value of 4 would mean to use one quarter, etc." t nil)

(autoload (quote vhdl-mode) "vhdl-mode" "\
Major mode for editing VHDL code.

Usage:
------

- TEMPLATE INSERTION (electrification):  After typing a VHDL keyword and
  entering `\\[vhdl-electric-space]', you are prompted for arguments while a template is generated
  for that VHDL construct.  Typing `\\[vhdl-electric-return]' or `\\[keyboard-quit]' at the first (mandatory)
  prompt aborts the current template generation.  Optional arguments are
  indicated by square brackets and removed if the queried string is left empty.
  Prompts for mandatory arguments remain in the code if the queried string is
  left empty.  They can be queried again by `\\[vhdl-template-search-prompt]'.
  Typing `\\[just-one-space]' after a keyword inserts a space without calling the template
  generator.  Automatic template generation (i.e. electrification) can be
  disabled (enabled) by typing `\\[vhdl-electric-mode]' or by setting custom variable
  `vhdl-electric-mode' (see CUSTOMIZATION).
  Enabled electrification is indicated by `/e' in the modeline.
  Template generators can be invoked from the VHDL menu, by key bindings, by
  typing `C-c C-i C-c' and choosing a construct, or by typing the keyword (i.e.
  first word of menu entry not in parenthesis) and `\\[vhdl-electric-space]'.
  The following abbreviations can also be used:
  arch, attr, cond, conf, comp, cons, func, inst, pack, sig, var.
  Template styles can be customized in customization group `vhdl-electric'
  (see CUSTOMIZATION).

- HEADER INSERTION:  A file header can be inserted by `\\[vhdl-template-header]'.  A
  file footer (template at the end of the file) can be inserted by
  `\\[vhdl-template-footer]'.  See customization group `vhdl-header'.

- STUTTERING:  Double striking of some keys inserts cumbersome VHDL syntax
  elements.  Stuttering can be disabled (enabled) by typing `\\[vhdl-stutter-mode]' or by
  variable `vhdl-stutter-mode'.  Enabled stuttering is indicated by `/s' in
  the modeline.  The stuttering keys and their effects are:
      ;;   -->  \" : \"         [   -->  (        --    -->  comment
      ;;;  -->  \" := \"        [[  -->  [        --CR  -->  comment-out code
      ..   -->  \" => \"        ]   -->  )        ---   -->  horizontal line
      ,,   -->  \" <= \"        ]]  -->  ]        ----  -->  display comment
      ==   -->  \" == \"        ''  -->  \\\"

- WORD COMPLETION:  Typing `\\[vhdl-electric-tab]' after a (not completed) word looks for a VHDL
  keyword or a word in the buffer that starts alike, inserts it and adjusts
  case.  Re-typing `\\[vhdl-electric-tab]' toggles through alternative word completions.
  This also works in the minibuffer (i.e. in template generator prompts).
  Typing `\\[vhdl-electric-tab]' after `(' looks for and inserts complete parenthesized
  expressions (e.g. for array index ranges).  All keywords as well as standard
  types and subprograms of VHDL have predefined abbreviations (e.g. type \"std\"
  and `\\[vhdl-electric-tab]' will toggle through all standard types beginning with \"std\").

  Typing `\\[vhdl-electric-tab]' after a non-word character indents the line if at the beginning
  of a line (i.e. no preceding non-blank characters),and inserts a tabulator
  stop otherwise.  `\\[tab-to-tab-stop]' always inserts a tabulator stop.

- COMMENTS:
      `--'       puts a single comment.
      `---'      draws a horizontal line for separating code segments.
      `----'     inserts a display comment, i.e. two horizontal lines with a
                 comment in between.
      `--CR'     comments out code on that line.  Re-hitting CR comments out
                 following lines.
      `\\[vhdl-comment-uncomment-region]'  comments out a region if not commented out,
                 uncomments a region if already commented out.

  You are prompted for comments after object definitions (i.e. signals,
  variables, constants, ports) and after subprogram and process specifications
  if variable `vhdl-prompt-for-comments' is non-nil.  Comments are
  automatically inserted as additional labels (e.g. after begin statements) and
  as help comments if `vhdl-self-insert-comments' is non-nil.
  Inline comments (i.e. comments after a piece of code on the same line) are
  indented at least to `vhdl-inline-comment-column'.  Comments go at maximum to
  `vhdl-end-comment-column'.  `\\[vhdl-electric-return]' after a space in a comment will open a
  new comment line.  Typing beyond `vhdl-end-comment-column' in a comment
  automatically opens a new comment line.  `\\[fill-paragraph]' re-fills
  multi-line comments.

- INDENTATION:  `\\[vhdl-electric-tab]' indents a line if at the beginning of the line.
  The amount of indentation is specified by variable `vhdl-basic-offset'.
  `\\[vhdl-indent-line]' always indents the current line (is bound to `TAB' if variable
  `vhdl-intelligent-tab' is nil).  Indentation can be done for an entire region
  (`\\[vhdl-indent-region]') or buffer (menu).  Argument and port lists are indented normally
  (nil) or relative to the opening parenthesis (non-nil) according to variable
  `vhdl-argument-list-indent'.  If variable `vhdl-indent-tabs-mode' is nil,
  spaces are used instead of tabs.  `\\[tabify]' and `\\[untabify]' allow
  to convert spaces to tabs and vice versa.

- ALIGNMENT:  The alignment functions align operators, keywords, and inline
  comment to beautify argument lists, port maps, etc.  `\\[vhdl-align-group]' aligns a group
  of consecutive lines separated by blank lines.  `\\[vhdl-align-noindent-region]' aligns an
  entire region.  If variable `vhdl-align-groups' is non-nil, groups of code
  lines separated by empty lines are aligned individually.  `\\[vhdl-align-inline-comment-group]' aligns
  inline comments for a group of lines, and `\\[vhdl-align-inline-comment-region]' for a region.
  Some templates are automatically aligned after generation if custom variable
  `vhdl-auto-align' is non-nil.
  `\\[vhdl-fixup-whitespace-region]' fixes up whitespace in a region.  That is, operator symbols
  are surrounded by one space, and multiple spaces are eliminated.

- PORT TRANSLATION:  Generic and port clauses from entity or component
  declarations can be copied (`\\[vhdl-port-copy]') and pasted as entity and
  component declarations, as component instantiations and corresponding
  internal constants and signals, as a generic map with constants as actual
  parameters, and as a test bench (menu).
  A clause with several generic/port names on the same line can be flattened
  (`\\[vhdl-port-flatten]') so that only one name per line exists.  Names for actual
  ports, instances, test benches, and design-under-test instances can be
  derived from existing names according to variables `vhdl-...-name'.
  Variables `vhdl-testbench-...' allow the insertion of additional templates
  into a test bench.  New files are created for the test bench entity and
  architecture according to variable `vhdl-testbench-create-files'.
  See customization group `vhdl-port'.

- TEST BENCH GENERATION:  See PORT TRANSLATION.

- KEY BINDINGS:  Key bindings (`C-c ...') exist for most commands (see in
  menu).

- VHDL MENU:  All commands can be invoked from the VHDL menu.

- FILE BROWSER:  The speedbar allows browsing of directories and file contents.
  It can be accessed from the VHDL menu and is automatically opened if
  variable `vhdl-speedbar' is non-nil.
  In speedbar, open files and directories with `mouse-2' on the name and
  browse/rescan their contents with `mouse-2'/`S-mouse-2' on the `+'.

- DESIGN HIERARCHY BROWSER:  The speedbar can also be used for browsing the
  hierarchy of design units contained in the source files of the current
  directory or in the source files/directories specified for a project (see
  variable `vhdl-project-alist').
  The speedbar can be switched between file and hierarchy browsing mode in the
  VHDL menu or by typing `f' and `h' in speedbar.
  In speedbar, open design units with `mouse-2' on the name and browse their
  hierarchy with `mouse-2' on the `+'.  The hierarchy can be rescanned and
  ports directly be copied from entities by using the speedbar menu.

- PROJECTS:  Projects can be defined in variable `vhdl-project-alist' and a
  current project be selected using variable `vhdl-project' (permanently) or
  from the menu (temporarily).  For each project, a title string (for the file
  headers) and source files/directories (for the hierarchy browser) can be
  specified.

- SPECIAL MENUES:  As an alternative to the speedbar, an index menu can
  be added (set variable `vhdl-index-menu' to non-nil) or made accessible
  as a mouse menu (e.g. add \"(global-set-key '[S-down-mouse-3] 'imenu)\" to
  your start-up file) for browsing the file contents.  Also, a source file menu
  can be added (set variable `vhdl-source-file-menu' to non-nil) for browsing
  the current directory for VHDL source files.

- SOURCE FILE COMPILATION:  The syntax of the current buffer can be analyzed
  by calling a VHDL compiler (menu, `\\[vhdl-compile]').  The compiler to be used is
  specified by variable `vhdl-compiler'.  The available compilers are listed
  in variable `vhdl-compiler-alist' including all required compilation command,
  destination directory, and error message syntax information.  New compilers
  can be added.  Additional compile command options can be set in variable
  `vhdl-compiler-options'.
  An entire hierarchy of source files can be compiled by the `make' command
  (menu, `\\[vhdl-make]').  This only works if an appropriate Makefile exists.
  The make command itself as well as a command to generate a Makefile can also
  be specified in variable `vhdl-compiler-alist'.

- VHDL STANDARDS:  The VHDL standards to be used are specified in variable
  `vhdl-standard'.  Available standards are: VHDL'87/'93, VHDL-AMS,
  Math Packages.

- KEYWORD CASE:  Lower and upper case for keywords and standardized types,
  attributes, and enumeration values is supported.  If the variable
  `vhdl-upper-case-keywords' is set to non-nil, keywords can be typed in lower
  case and are converted into upper case automatically (not for types,
  attributes, and enumeration values).  The case of keywords, types,
  attributes,and enumeration values can be fixed for an entire region (menu)
  or buffer (`\\[vhdl-fix-case-buffer]') according to the variables
  `vhdl-upper-case-{keywords,types,attributes,enum-values}'.

- HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):  Keywords and standardized types, attributes,
  enumeration values, and function names (controlled by variable
  `vhdl-highlight-keywords'), as well as comments, strings, and template
  prompts are highlighted using different colors.  Unit, subprogram, signal,
  variable, constant, parameter and generic/port names in declarations as well
  as labels are highlighted if variable `vhdl-highlight-names' is non-nil.

  Additional reserved words or words with a forbidden syntax (e.g. words that
  should be avoided) can be specified in variable `vhdl-forbidden-words' or
  `vhdl-forbidden-syntax' and be highlighted in a warning color (variable
  `vhdl-highlight-forbidden-words').  Verilog keywords are highlighted as
  forbidden words if variable `vhdl-highlight-verilog-keywords' is non-nil.

  Words with special syntax can be highlighted by specifying their syntax and
  color in variable `vhdl-special-syntax-alist' and by setting variable
  `vhdl-highlight-special-words' to non-nil.  This allows to establish some
  naming conventions (e.g. to distinguish different kinds of signals or other
  objects by using name suffices) and to support them visually.

  Variable `vhdl-highlight-case-sensitive' can be set to non-nil in order to
  support case-sensitive highlighting.  However, keywords are then only
  highlighted if written in lower case.

  Code between \"translate_off\" and \"translate_on\" pragmas is highlighted
  using a different background color if variable `vhdl-highlight-translate-off'
  is non-nil.

  All colors can be customized by command `\\[customize-face]'.
  For highlighting of matching parenthesis, see customization group
  `paren-showing' (`\\[customize-group]').

- USER MODELS:  VHDL models (templates) can be specified by the user and made
  accessible in the menu, through key bindings (`C-c C-m ...'), or by keyword
  electrification.  See custom variable `vhdl-model-alist'.

- HIDE/SHOW:  The code of entire VHDL design units can be hidden using the
  `Hide/Show' menu or by pressing `S-mouse-2' within the code (variable
  `vhdl-hideshow-menu').

- PRINTING:  Postscript printing with different faces (an optimized set of
  faces is used if `vhdl-print-customize-faces' is non-nil) or colors
  (if `ps-print-color-p' is non-nil) is possible using the standard Emacs
  postscript printing commands.  Variable `vhdl-print-two-column' defines
  appropriate default settings for nice landscape two-column printing.  The
  paper format can be set by variable `ps-paper-type'.  Do not forget to
  switch `ps-print-color-p' to nil for printing on black-and-white printers.

- CUSTOMIZATION:  All variables can easily be customized using the `Customize'
  menu entry or `\\[customize-option]' (`\\[customize-group]' for groups).
  Some customizations only take effect after some action (read the NOTE in
  the variable documentation).  Customization can also be done globally (i.e.
  site-wide, read the INSTALL file).

- FILE EXTENSIONS:  As default, files with extensions \".vhd\" and \".vhdl\" are
  automatically recognized as VHDL source files.  To add an extension \".xxx\",
  add the following line to your Emacs start-up file (`.emacs'):
    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(\"\\\\.xxx\\\\'\" . vhdl-mode) auto-mode-alist))

- HINTS:
  - Type `\\[keyboard-quit] \\[keyboard-quit]' to interrupt long operations or if Emacs hangs.

;;; Generated autoloads from emulation/vi.el

(autoload (quote vi-mode) "vi" "\
Major mode that acts like the `vi' editor.
The purpose of this mode is to provide you the combined power of vi (namely,
the \"cross product\" effect of commands and repeat last changes) and Emacs.

This command redefines nearly all keys to look like vi commands.
It records the previous major mode, and any vi command for input
\(`i', `a', `s', etc.) switches back to that mode.
Thus, ordinary Emacs (in whatever major mode you had been using)
is \"input\" mode as far as vi is concerned.

To get back into vi from \"input\" mode, you must issue this command again.
Therefore, it is recommended that you assign it to a key.

Major differences between this mode and real vi :

* Limitations and unsupported features
  - Search patterns with line offset (e.g. /pat/+3 or /pat/z.) are
    not supported.
  - Ex commands are not implemented; try ':' to get some hints.
  - No line undo (i.e. the 'U' command), but multi-undo is a standard feature.

* Modifications
  - The stopping positions for some point motion commands (word boundary,
    pattern search) are slightly different from standard 'vi'.
    Also, no automatic wrap around at end of buffer for pattern searching.
  - Since changes are done in two steps (deletion then insertion), you need
    to undo twice to completely undo a change command.  But this is not needed
    for undoing a repeated change command.
  - No need to set/unset 'magic', to search for a string with regular expr
    in it just put a prefix arg for the search commands.  Replace cmds too.
  - ^R is bound to incremental backward search, so use ^L to redraw screen.

* Extensions
  - Some standard (or modified) Emacs commands were integrated, such as
    incremental search, query replace, transpose objects, and keyboard macros.
  - In command state, ^X links to the 'ctl-x-map', and ESC can be linked to
    esc-map or set undefined.  These can give you the full power of Emacs.
  - See vi-com-map for those keys that are extensions to standard vi, e.g.
    `vi-name-last-change-or-macro', `vi-verify-spelling', `vi-locate-def',
    `vi-mark-region', and 'vi-quote-words'.  Some of them are quite handy.
  - Use \\[vi-switch-mode] to switch among different modes quickly.

\\[View-exit]	exit View mode but stay in current buffer.  Use this if you started
	  viewing a buffer (file) and find out you want to edit it.
\\[View-exit-and-edit]	exit View mode and make the current buffer editable.
\\[View-quit-all]	quit View mode, trying to restore windows and buffer to previous state.
\\[View-leave]	quit View mode and maybe switch buffers, but don't kill this buffer.
\\[View-kill-and-leave]	quit View mode, kill current buffer and go back to other buffer.

The effect of \\[View-leave] , \\[View-quit] and \\[View-kill-and-leave] depends on how view-mode was entered.  If it was
entered by view-file, view-file-other-window or view-file-other-frame (\\[view-file],
\\[view-file-other-window], \\[view-file-other-frame] or the dired mode v command), then \\[View-quit] will try to kill the
current buffer.  If view-mode was entered from another buffer as is done by
View-buffer, View-buffer-other-window, View-buffer-other frame, View-file,
View-file-other-window or View-file-other-frame then \\[view-leave] , \\[view-quit] and \\[view-kill-and-leave] will return
to that buffer.

RETURN-TO is either nil, meaning do nothing when exiting view mode, or
