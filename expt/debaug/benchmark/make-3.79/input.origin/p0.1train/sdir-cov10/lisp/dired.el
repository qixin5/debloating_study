  "\
Mode for \"editing\" directory listings.
In dired, you are \"editing\" a list of the files in a directory and
  \(optionally) its subdirectories, in the format of `ls -lR'.
  Each directory is a page: use \\[backward-page] and \\[forward-page] to move pagewise.
\"Editing\" means that you can run shell commands on files, visit,
  compress, load or byte-compile them, change their file attributes
  and insert subdirectories into the same buffer.  You can \"mark\"
  files for later commands or \"flag\" them for deletion, either file
  by file or all files matching certain criteria.
You can move using the usual cursor motion commands.\\<dired-mode-map>
Letters no longer insert themselves.  Digits are prefix arguments.
Instead, type \\[dired-flag-file-deletion] to flag a file for Deletion.
Type \\[dired-mark] to Mark a file or subdirectory for later commands.
  Most commands operate on the marked files and use the current file
  if no files are marked.  Use a numeric prefix argument to operate on
  the next ARG (or previous -ARG if ARG<0) files, or just `1'
  to operate on the current file only.  Prefix arguments override marks.
  Mark-using commands display a list of failures afterwards.  Type \\[dired-summary]
  to see why something went wrong.
Type \\[dired-unmark] to Unmark a file or all files of a subdirectory.
Type \\[dired-unmark-backward] to back up one line and unflag.
Type \\[dired-do-flagged-delete] to eXecute the deletions requested.
Type \\[dired-advertised-find-file] to Find the current line's file
  (or dired it in another buffer, if it is a directory).
Type \\[dired-find-file-other-window] to find file or dired directory in Other window.
Type \\[dired-maybe-insert-subdir] to Insert a subdirectory in this buffer.
Type \\[dired-do-rename] to Rename a file or move the marked files to another directory.
Type \\[dired-do-copy] to Copy files.
Type \\[dired-sort-toggle-or-edit] to toggle sorting by name/date or change the `ls' switches.
Type \\[revert-buffer] to read all currently expanded directories again.
  This retains all marks and hides subdirs again that were hidden before.
SPC and DEL can be used to move down and up by lines.

If dired ever gets confused, you can either type \\[revert-buffer] \
to read the
directories again, type \\[dired-do-redisplay] \
to relist a single or the marked files or a
subdirectory, or type \\[dired-build-subdir-alist] to parse the buffer
again for the directory tree.
