GNU Backgammon documentation

This is the GNU Backgammon manual.  `make' will build gnubg.info by
default, but if you have the necessary tools you can generate a DVI or
PostScript manual with `make dvi' or `make ps'.  These formats are
more suitable for printing.

You can also build the manual as plain text or HTML, with `make txt'
or `make html' respectively.
