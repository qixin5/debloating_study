We are pleased to announce the version 1.2 test release of GNU Hello.
All reported bugs in previous test releases have been fixed.
Some bugs surely remain.

The GNU implementation of this classic program is brought to you by
the efforts of several people, including Mike Haertel, David MacKenzie,
Jan Brittenson, Roland McGrath, Charles Hannum, and The King.

The basic algorithm is described in: "The C Programming Language", by
B. W. Kernighan and D. M. Ritchie, Prentice-Hall, New Jersey, 1978;
the program is an enhancement of the one published in that book.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

Please send all bug reports by electronic mail to:
    bug-gnu-hello@prep.ai.mit.edu

GNU Hello is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
