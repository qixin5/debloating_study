;;; Code:

(provide 'mh-mime)
(require 'mh-comp)


;; To do:
;; paragraph code should not fill # lines if MIME enabled.
;; implement mh-auto-edit-mhn (if non-nil, \\[mh-send-letter]
;;	invokes mh-edit-mhn automatically before sending.)
;;      actually, instead of mh-auto-edit-mhn,
;;      should read automhnproc from profile
;; MIME option to mh-forward
;; command to move to content-description insertion point
