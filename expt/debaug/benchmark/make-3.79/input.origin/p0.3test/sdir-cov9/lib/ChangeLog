Tue Feb 13 13:12:19 2001  Gary Wong  <gtw@research.att.com>

	(and weren't even used).

Fri Nov 10 13:45:53 2000  Gary Wong  <gtw@research.att.com>

	* neuralnet.c (sigmoid): Optimisations.
	(NeuralNetCreate, NeuralNetResize): Use irand() instead of rand_r(),

	* neuralnet.c: Improve sigmoid accuracy by using a table lookup for
