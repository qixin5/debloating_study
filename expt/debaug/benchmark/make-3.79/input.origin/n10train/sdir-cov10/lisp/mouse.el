;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides various useful commands (including help
;; system access) through the mouse.  All this code assumes that mouse
;; interpretation has been abstracted into Emacs input events.
;;
;; The code is rather X-dependent.

;;; Code:

;;; Utility functions.

;;; Indent track-mouse like progn.
