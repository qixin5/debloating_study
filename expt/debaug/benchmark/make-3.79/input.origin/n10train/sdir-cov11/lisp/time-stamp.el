;;; Commentary:

;; A template in a file can be updated with a new time stamp when
;; you save the file.  For example:
;;     static char *ts = "sdmain.c Time-stamp: <1996-08-13 10:20:51 gildea>";
;; See the top of `time-stamp.el' for another example.

;; To use time-stamping, add this line to your .emacs file:
;;     (add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'time-stamp)
;; Now any time-stamp templates in your files will be updated automatically.

;; See the documentation for the functions `time-stamp'
;; and `time-stamp-toggle-active' for details.

  "*Format of the string inserted by \\[time-stamp].
The value may be a string or a list.  Lists are supported only for
backward compatibility; see variable `time-stamp-old-format-warn'.

A string is used verbatim except for character sequences beginning with %:

%:a  weekday name: `Monday'.		%#A gives uppercase: `MONDAY'
%3a  abbreviated weekday: `Mon'.	%3A gives uppercase: `MON'
%:b  month name: `January'.		%#B gives uppercase: `JANUARY'
%3b  abbreviated month: `Jan'.		%3B gives uppercase: `JAN'
%02d day of month
%02H 24-hour clock hour
%02I 12-hour clock hour
%02m month number
%02M minute
%#p  `am' or `pm'.			%P  gives uppercase: `AM' or `PM'
%02S seconds
%w   day number of week, Sunday is 0
%02y 2-digit year: `97'			%:y 4-digit year: `1997'
%z   time zone name: `est'.		%Z  gives uppercase: `EST'

Non-date items:
%%   a literal percent character: `%'
%f   file name without directory	%F  gives absolute pathname
%s   system name
%u   user's login name			%U  user's full name
%h   mail host name

Decimal digits between the % and the type character specify the
field width.  Strings are truncated on the right; years on the left.
A leading zero causes numbers to be zero-filled.

For example, to get the format used by the `date' command,
use \"%3a %3b %2d %02H:%02M:%02S %Z %:y\".

In the future these formats will be aligned more with format-time-string.
Because of this transition, the default padding for numeric formats will
change in a future version.  Therefore either a padding width should be
specified, or the : modifier should be used to explicitly request the
historical default."

of lines at the beginning (negative counts from end) of the file searched
for the time-stamp.  The number and the slash may be omitted to use the
normal value.

The second part is a regexp identifying the pattern preceding the time stamp.
This part may be omitted to use the normal pattern.

The third part specifies the format of the time-stamp inserted.  See
the documentation for time-stamp-format for details.  Specify this
part as \"%%\" to use the normal format.

The fourth part is a regexp identifying the pattern following the time stamp.
This part may be omitted to use the normal pattern.

\"8/Time-stamp: [\\\"<]%:y-%02m-%02d %02H:%02M:%02S %u[\\\">]\"
