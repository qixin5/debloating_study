The following keywords are meaningful:

	The default is `sexp'.
:options VALUE should be a list of valid members of the widget type.
:group  VALUE should be a customization group.  
        Add SYMBOL to that group.
:initialize
	VALUE should be a function used to initialize the
	variable.  It takes two arguments, the symbol and value
	given in the `defcustom' call.  The default is
	`custom-initialize-default' 
:set	VALUE should be a function to set the value of the symbol. 
	It takes two arguments, the symbol to set and the value to
	give it.  The default choice of function is `custom-set-default'.
:get	VALUE should be a function to extract the value of symbol.
	The function takes one argument, a symbol, and should return
	the current value for that symbol.  The default choice of function
	is `custom-default-value'. 
:require
	VALUE should be a feature symbol.  If you save a value
	for this option, then when your `.emacs' file loads the value,
	it does (require VALUE) first.

information."

SPEC should be an alist of the form ((DISPLAY ATTS)...).

The first element of SPEC where the DISPLAY matches the frame
is the one that takes effect in that frame.  The ATTRs in this
element take effect; the other elements are ignored, on that frame.

ATTS is a list of face attributes followed by their values:
  (ATTR VALUE ATTR VALUE...)
The possible attributes are `:bold', `:italic', `:underline',
`:foreground', `:background', `:stipple' and `:inverse-video'.

DISPLAY can either be the symbol t, which will match all frames, or an
alist of the form \((REQ ITEM...)...).  For the DISPLAY to match a
FRAME, the REQ property of the frame must match one of the ITEM.  The
following REQ are defined:

`type' (the value of `window-system')

`class' (the frame's color support)
  Should be one of `color', `grayscale', or `mono'.

`background' (what color is used for the background text)
