;;; Commentary:
;;    This package provides functions to query CCSO PH/QI nameservers
;;    through an interactive form or replace inline query strings in
;;    buffers with appropriately formatted query results (especially
;;    used to expand email addresses in message buffers).  It also
;;    interfaces with the BBDB package to let you register entries of
;;    the CCSO PH/QI directory into your own database.  The CCSO PH/QI
;;    white pages system was developped at UIUC and is in use in more
;;    than 300 sites in the world.  The distribution can be found at
;;    ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/packages/ph Traditionally the
;;    server is called QI while the client is called PH.

;;; Installation:
;;    This package uses the custom and widget libraries.  If they are not already 
;;    installed on your system get them from http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/
;;    Then uncomment and add the following to your .emacs file:
;;      (require 'ph)
;;      (eval-after-load "message"
;;                       '(define-key message-mode-map [(control ?c) (tab)] 'ph-expand-inline))
;;      (eval-after-load "mail"
;;                       '(define-key mail-mode-map [(control ?c) (tab)] 'ph-expand-inline))
;;    See the info file for details

;;    This package runs under XEmacs 19.15 or 20 and under Emacs 19.34 and above

;;; Usage:
;;    - Provided you did the installation as proposed in the above section, 
;;      inline expansion will be available when you compose an email
;;      message.  Type the name of somebody recorded in your PH/QI server and hit
;;      C-c TAB, this will overwrite the name with the corresponding email 
;;      address
;;    - M-x ph-customize to customize inline expansion and other features to
;;      your needs.
;;    - Look for the Ph submenu in the Tools menu for more.
;;    See the info file for details.
