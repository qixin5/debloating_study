;;; Commentary:

;; Loading this package implements a more fine-grained minibuffer
;; completion feedback scheme.  Prospective completions are concisely
;; indicated within the minibuffer itself, with each successive
;; keystroke.

;; See `icomplete-completions' docstring for a description of the
;; icomplete display format.

;; See the `icomplete-minibuffer-setup-hook' docstring for a means to
;; customize icomplete setup for interoperation with other
;; minibuffer-oriented packages.

;; To activate icomplete mode, simply add the following to .emacs:
;; (icomplete-mode)
;; You can subsequently deactivate it by invoking the function
;; icomplete-mode with a negative prefix-arg (C-U -1 ESC-x
;; icomplete-mode).  Also, you can prevent activation of the mode
;; during package load by first setting the variable `icomplete-mode'
;; to nil.  Icompletion can be enabled any time after the package is
;; loaded by invoking icomplete-mode without a prefix arg.

;; This version of icomplete runs on Emacs 19.18 and later.  (It
;; depends on the incorporation of minibuffer-setup-hook.)  The elisp
;; archives, ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive,
;; probably still has a version that works in GNU Emacs v18.

;; Thanks to everyone for their suggestions for refinements of this
;; package.  I particularly have to credit Michael Cook, who
;; implemented an incremental completion style in his 'iswitch'
;; functions that served as a model for icomplete.  Some other
;; contributors: Noah Friedman (restructuring as minor mode), Colin
;; Rafferty (lemacs reconciliation), Lars Lindberg, RMS, and others.
