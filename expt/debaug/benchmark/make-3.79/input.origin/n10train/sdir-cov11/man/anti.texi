@appendix Emacs 19 Antinews

  For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 19.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of certain Emacs 20 features.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The multibyte character and end-of-line conversion support have been
eliminated entirely.  (Some users consider this a tremendous
improvement.)  Character codes are limited to the range 0 through 255
and files imported onto Unix-like systems may have a ^M at the end of
each line to remind you to control MS-DOG type files.

@item
Fontsets, coding systems and input methods have been eliminated as well.

@item
The mode line normally displays the string @samp{Emacs}, in case you
forget what editor you are using.

@item
Scroll bars always appear on the right-hand side of the window.
This clearly separates them from the text in the window.

@item
The @kbd{M-x customize} feature has been replaced with a very simple
feature, @kbd{M-x edit-options}.  This shows you @emph{all} the user
options right from the start, so you don't have to hunt for the ones you
want.  It also provides a few commands, such as @kbd{s} and @kbd{x}, to
set a user option.

@item
The @key{DELETE} key does nothing special in Emacs 19 when you use it
after selecting a region with the mouse.  It does exactly the same thing
in that situation as it does at all other times: delete one character
backwards.

@item
@kbd{C-x C-w} no longer changes the major mode according to the new file
name.  If you want to change the mode, use @kbd{M-x normal-mode}.

@item
In Transient Mark mode, each window displays highlighting for the region
as it exists in that window.

@item
Outline mode doesn't use overlay properties; instead, it hides a line by
converting the preceding newline into code 015.  Magically, however, if
you save the file, the 015 character appears in the file as a newline.

@item
There is now a clever way you can activate the minibuffer recursively
even if @code{enable-recursive-minibuffers} is @code{nil}.  All you have
to do is @emph{switch windows} to a non-minibuffer window, and then use a
minibuffer command.  You can pile up any number of minibuffer levels
this way, but @kbd{M-x top-level} will get you out of all of them.

@item
We have removed the limit on the length of minibuffer history lists;
they now contain all the minibuffer arguments you have used since the
beginning of the session.

@item
Dynamic abbrev expansion now handles case conversion in a very simple
and straightforward way.  If you have requested preserving case, it
always converts the entire expansion to the case pattern of the abbrev
that you have typed in.

@item
The @code{compose-mail} command does not exist; @kbd{C-x m} now
runs @code{mail} directly.

@item
There is no way to quote a file name with special characters in it.
What you see is what you get: if the name looks remote, it is remote.

@item
@kbd{M-x grep-find} has been eliminated, because @code{grep} has never
been lost.

@ignore
@item
Truth in advertising: @kbd{M-x grep} by default uses @code{grep}, the
whole @code{grep}, and nothing but the @code{grep}.  If you want it to
use @code{zgrep}, you'll have to edit the search command by hand.
@end ignore

@item
Some Dired commands have been rearranged: two-character sequences
have been replaced with quick single-character commands:

@itemize @bullet
@item
For @code{dired-mark-executables}, type @kbd{*}.
@item
For @code{dired-mark-directories}, type @kbd{/}.
@item
For @code{dired-mark-symlinks}, type @kbd{@@}.
@item
For @code{dired-change-marks}, type @kbd{c}.
@item
For @code{dired-unmark-all-files}, type @kbd{C-M-?}.
@item
For @code{dired-unmark-all-marks}, type @kbd{C-M-? @key{RET}}.
@end itemize

But if you want to use @code{dired-flag-garbage-files}, @kbd{&}, you'll
just have to stop living in the past.

@item 
In C mode, you can now specify your preferred style for block comments.
If you want to use the style

@example
/*       
blah     
blah     
*/       
@end example

@noindent
then you should set the variable @code{c-block-comments-indent-p} to
@code{t}.

@item
To customize faces used by Font Lock mode, use the variable
@code{font-lock-face-attributes}.  See its documentation string for
details.

@item
For efficiency, Font Lock mode now uses by default the minimum supported
level of decoration for the selected major mode.

@item
If you kill a buffer, any registers holding saved positions in that
buffer are changed to point into limbo.

@item
The function @code{set-frame-font} has been renamed to
@code{set-default-font}.

@item
The variable @code{tex-main-file} doesn't exist.  Of course, you can
create the variable by setting it, but that won't do anything special.

@item
The @code{scroll-preserve-screen-position} variable has been eliminated;
and so has the feature that it controls.

@item
We have eliminated the functions @code{add-untranslated-filesystem} and
@code{remove-untranslated-filesystem}, and replaced them with a simpler
function, @code{using-unix-filesystems}.

@item
To keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity, many other
functions and files have been eliminated in Emacs 19.  There's no need
to mention them all here.  If you try to use one of them, you'll get an
error message to tell you that it is undefined or unbound.
@end itemize
