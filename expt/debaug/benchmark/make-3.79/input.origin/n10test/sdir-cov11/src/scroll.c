/* Determine, in matrix[i,j], the cost of updating the first j
   old lines into the first i new lines using the direct
   scrolling method.  When the old line and the new line have
   different hash codes, the calculated cost of updating old
   line j into new line i includes the cost of outputting new
   line i, and if i != j, the cost of outputting the old line j
   is also included, as a penalty for moving the line and then
   erasing it.  In addition, the cost of updating a sequence of
   lines with constant i - j includes the cost of scrolling the
   old lines into their new positions, unless i == j.  Scrolling
   is achieved by setting the screen window to avoid affecting
   other lines below, and inserting or deleting lines at the top
   of the scrolled region.  The cost of scrolling a sequence of
   lines includes the fixed cost of specifying a scroll region,
   plus a variable cost which can depend upon the number of lines
   involved and the distance by which they are scrolled, and an
   extra cost to discourage long scrolls.

   As reflected in the matrix, an insert or delete does not
   correspond directly to the insertion or deletion which is
   used in scrolling lines.  An insert means that the value of i
   has increased without a corresponding increase in the value
   of j.  A delete means that the value of j has increased
   without a corresponding increase in the value of i.  A write
   means that i and j are both increased by the same amount, and
   that the old lines will be moved to their new positions.

   An insert following a delete is allowed only if i > j.
   A delete following an insert is allowed only if i < j.
   These restrictions ensure that the new lines in an insert
   will always be blank as an effect of the neighboring writes.
   Thus the calculated cost of an insert is simply the cost of
   outputting the new line contents.  The direct cost of a
   delete is zero.  Inserts and deletes indirectly affect the
   total cost through their influence on subsequent writes. */

/* Perform insert-lines and delete-lines operations on FRAME according
   to the costs in MATRIX, using the direct scrolling method.
   Update the frame's current_glyphs info to record what was done.

   WINDOW_SIZE is the number of lines being considered for scrolling
   and UNCHANGED_AT_TOP is the vpos of the first line being considered.
   These two arguments can specify any contiguous range of lines.
 
   We also shuffle the charstarts vectors for the lines
   along with the glyphs; but the results are not quite right,
   since we cannot offset them for changes in amount of text
   in this line or that line.  Luckily it doesn't matter,
   since update_frame and update_line will copy in the proper
   new charstarts vectors from the frame's desired_glyphs.

   In the direct scrolling method, a new scroll window is selected
   before each insertion or deletion, so that groups of lines can be
   scrolled directly to their final vertical positions.  This method
   is described in more detail in calculate_direct_scrolling,
   where the cost matrix for this approach is constructed. */

/* Calculate the insert and delete line costs.
   Note that this is done even when running with a window system
   because we want to know how long scrolling takes (and avoid it).
   This must be redone whenever the frame height changes.

   We keep the ID costs in a precomputed array based on the position
   at which the I or D is performed.  Also, there are two kinds of ID
   costs: the "once-only" and the "repeated".  This is to handle both
   those terminals that are able to insert N lines at a time (once-
   only) and those that must repeatedly insert one line.

   The cost to insert N lines at line L is
   	    [tt.t_ILov  + (frame_height + 1 - L) * tt.t_ILpf] +
	N * [tt.t_ILnov + (frame_height + 1 - L) * tt.t_ILnpf]

   ILov represents the basic insert line overhead.  ILpf is the padding
   required to allow the terminal time to move a line: insertion at line
   L changes (frame_height + 1 - L) lines.

   The first bracketed expression above is the overhead; the second is
   the multiply factor.  Both are dependent only on the position at
   which the insert is performed.  We store the overhead in
   FRAME_INSERT_COST (frame) and the multiply factor in
   FRAME_INSERTN_COST (frame).  Note however that any insertion
   must include at least one multiply factor.  Rather than compute this
   as FRAME_INSERT_COST (frame)[line]+FRAME_INSERTN_COST (frame)[line],
   we add FRAME_INSERTN_COST (frame) into FRAME_INSERT_COST (frame).
   This is reasonable because of the particular algorithm used in calcM.

   Deletion is essentially the same as insertion.
