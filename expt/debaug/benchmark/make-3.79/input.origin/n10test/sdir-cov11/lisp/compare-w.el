;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides one entry point, compare-windows.  It compares
;; text starting from point in two adjacent windows, advancing point
;; until it finds a difference.  Option variables permit you to ignore
;; whitespace differences, or case differences, or both.

;;; Code:

(defgroup compare-w nil
  "Compare text between windows."
  :prefix "compare-"
  :group 'tools)

(defcustom compare-windows-whitespace "[ \t\n]+"
  "*Regexp that defines whitespace sequences for \\[compare-windows].
Changes in whitespace are optionally ignored.

The value of `compare-windows-whitespace' may instead be a function; this
function is called in each buffer, with point at the current scanning point.
The function's job is to categorize any whitespace around (including before)
point; it should also advance past any whitespace.

The function is passed one argument, the point where `compare-windows'
was originally called; it should not consider any text before that point.
If the function returns the same value for both buffers, then the
whitespace is considered to match, and is skipped."

  "Compare text in current window with text in next window.
Compares the text starting at point in each window,
moving over text in each one as far as they match.

This command pushes the mark in each window
at the prior location of point in that window.
If both windows display the same buffer,
the mark is pushed twice in that buffer:
first in the other window, then in the selected window.

A prefix arg means ignore changes in whitespace.
The variable `compare-windows-whitespace' controls how whitespace is skipped.
If `compare-ignore-case' is non-nil, changes in case are also ignored."
