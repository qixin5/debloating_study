;;; Commentary:

;; This collection of functions implements a calendar window.  It generates a
;; calendar for the current month, together with the previous and coming
;; months, or for any other three-month period.  The calendar can be scrolled
;; forward and backward in the window to show months in the past or future;
;; the cursor can move forward and backward by days, weeks, or months, making
;; it possible, for instance, to jump to the date a specified number of days,
;; weeks, or months from the date under the cursor.  The user can display a
;; list of holidays and other notable days for the period shown; the notable
;; days can be marked on the calendar, if desired.  The user can also specify
;; that dates having corresponding diary entries (in a file that the user
;; specifies) be marked; the diary entries for any date can be viewed in a
;; separate window.  The diary and the notable days can be viewed
;; independently of the calendar.  Dates can be translated from the (usual)
;; Gregorian calendar to the day of the year/days remaining in year, to the
;; ISO commercial calendar, to the Julian (old style) calendar, to the Hebrew
;; calendar, to the Islamic calendar, to the French Revolutionary calendar, to
;; the Mayan calendar, to the Chinese calendar, to the Coptic calendar, to the
;; Ethiopic calendar, and to the astronomical (Julian) day number.  When
;; floating point is available, times of sunrise/sunset can be displayed, as
;; can the phases of the moon.  Appointment notification for diary entries is
;; available.  Calendar printing via LaTeX is available.

;; The following files are part of the calendar/diary code:

;;       appt.el                       Appointment notification
;;       cal-china.el                  Chinese calendar

(defcustom diary-file "~/diary"
  "*Name of the file in which one's personal diary of dates is kept.

The file's entries are lines in any of the forms

            MONTH/DAY
            MONTH/DAY/YEAR
            MONTHNAME DAY
            MONTHNAME DAY, YEAR
            DAYNAME

at the beginning of the line; the remainder of the line is the diary entry
string for that date.  MONTH and DAY are one or two digit numbers, YEAR is
a number and may be written in full or abbreviated to the final two digits.
If the date does not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any year.
DAYNAME entries apply to any date on which is on that day of the week.
MONTHNAME and DAYNAME can be spelled in full, abbreviated to three
characters (with or without a period), capitalized or not.  Any of DAY,
MONTH, or MONTHNAME, YEAR can be `*' which matches any day, month, or year,
respectively.

The European style (in which the day precedes the month) can be used
instead, if you execute `european-calendar' when in the calendar, or set
`european-calendar-style' to t in your .emacs file.  The European forms are

            DAY/MONTH
            DAY/MONTH/YEAR
            DAY MONTHNAME
            DAY MONTHNAME YEAR
            DAYNAME

To revert to the default American style from the European style, execute
`american-calendar' in the calendar.

A diary entry can be preceded by the character
`diary-nonmarking-symbol' (ordinarily `&') to make that entry
nonmarking--that is, it will not be marked on dates in the calendar
window but will appear in a diary window.

Multiline diary entries are made by indenting lines after the first with
either a TAB or one or more spaces.

Lines not in one the above formats are ignored.  Here are some sample diary
entries (in the default American style):

     12/22/1988 Twentieth wedding anniversary!!
     &1/1. Happy New Year!
     10/22 Ruth's birthday.
     21: Payday
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
              Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
     1/13/89 Friday the thirteenth!!
     &thu 4pm squash game with Lloyd.
     mar 16 Dad's birthday
     April 15, 1989 Income tax due.
     &* 15 time cards due.

If the first line of a diary entry consists only of the date or day name with
no trailing blanks or punctuation, then that line is not displayed in the
diary window; only the continuation lines is shown.  For example, the
single diary entry

     02/11/1989
      Bill Blattner visits Princeton today
      2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
      2:30-5:30 Lizzie at Lawrenceville for `Group Initiative'
      4:00pm Jamie Tappenden
      7:30pm Dinner at George and Ed's for Alan Ryan
      7:30-10:00pm dance at Stewart Country Day School

will appear in the diary window without the date line at the beginning.  This
facility allows the diary window to look neater, but can cause confusion if
used with more than one day's entries displayed.

Diary entries can be based on Lisp sexps.  For example, the diary entry

      %%(diary-block 11 1 1990 11 10 1990) Vacation

causes the diary entry \"Vacation\" to appear from November 1 through November
10, 1990.  Other functions available are `diary-float', `diary-anniversary',
`diary-cyclic', `diary-day-of-year', `diary-iso-date', `diary-french-date',
`diary-hebrew-date', `diary-islamic-date', `diary-mayan-date',
`diary-chinese-date', `diary-coptic-date', `diary-ethiopic-date',
`diary-persian-date', `diary-yahrzeit', `diary-sunrise-sunset',
`diary-phases-of-moon', `diary-parasha', `diary-omer', `diary-rosh-hodesh',
and `diary-sabbath-candles'.  See the documentation for the function
`list-sexp-diary-entries' for more details.

Diary entries based on the Hebrew and/or the Islamic calendar are also
possible, but because these are somewhat slow, they are ignored
unless you set the `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook' and the
`nongregorian-diary-marking-hook' appropriately.  See the documentation
for these functions for details.

Diary files can contain directives to include the contents of other files; for

A pseudo-pattern is a list of regular expressions and the keywords `month',
`day', `year', `monthname', and `dayname'.  The keyword `monthname' will
match the name of the month, capitalized or not, or its three-letter
abbreviation, followed by a period or not; it will also match `*'.
Similarly, `dayname' will match the name of the day, capitalized or not, or
its three-letter abbreviation, followed by a period or not.  The keywords
`month', `day', and `year' will match those numerical values, preceded by
arbitrarily many zeros; they will also match `*'.

The matching of the diary entries with the date forms is done with the
standard syntax table from Fundamental mode, but with the `*' changed so
that it is a word constituent.

If, to be mutually exclusive, a pseudo-pattern must match a portion of the
diary entry itself, the first element of the pattern MUST be `backup'.  This
directive causes the date recognizer to back up to the beginning of the

with your own.  The files included are specified in the diary file by lines
of the form

        #include \"filename\"

This is recursive; that is, #include directives in files thus included are
obeyed.  You can change the \"#include\" to some other string by changing
the variable `diary-include-string'.  When you use `include-other-diary-files'
as part of the list-diary-entries-hook, you will probably also want to use the
function `mark-included-diary-files' as part of `mark-diary-entries-hook'.

For example, you could use

     (setq list-diary-entries-hook
       '(include-other-diary-files sort-diary-entries))
     (setq diary-display-hook 'fancy-diary-display)

in your `.emacs' file to cause the fancy diary buffer to be displayed with
diary entries from various included files, each day's entries sorted into
lexicographic order."

functions are called, the variable `diary-entries-list' is a list, in order

used, for example, a different buffer for display (perhaps combined with
holidays), or produce hard copy output.

A function `fancy-diary-display' is provided as an alternative
choice for this hook; this function prepares a special noneditable diary
buffer with the relevant diary entries that has neat day-by-day arrangement
with headings.  The fancy diary buffer will show the holidays unless the
variable `holidays-in-diary-buffer' is set to nil.  Ordinarily, the fancy

  "*List of notable days for the command M-x holidays.

Additional holidays are easy to add to the list, just put them in the list
`other-holidays' in your .emacs file.  Similarly, by setting any of
`general-holidays', `local-holidays' `christian-holidays', `hebrew-holidays',
`islamic-holidays', `oriental-holidays', or `solar-holidays' to nil in your
.emacs file, you can eliminate unwanted categories of holidays.  The intention
is that (in the US) `local-holidays' be set in site-init.el and
`other-holidays' be set by the user.

Entries on the list are expressions that return (possibly empty) lists of
items of the form ((month day year) string) of a holiday in the in the
three-month period centered around `displayed-month' of `displayed-year'.
Several basic functions are provided for this purpose:

    (holiday-fixed MONTH DAY STRING) is a fixed date on the Gregorian calendar
    (holiday-float MONTH DAYNAME K STRING &optional day) is the Kth DAYNAME in
                               MONTH on the Gregorian calendar (0 for Sunday,
                               etc.); K<0 means count back from the end of the
                               month. An optional parameter DAY means the Kth
                               DAYNAME after/before MONTH DAY.
    (holiday-hebrew MONTH DAY STRING)  a fixed date on the Hebrew calendar
    (holiday-islamic MONTH DAY STRING) a fixed date on the Islamic calendar
    (holiday-julian MONTH DAY STRING)  a fixed date on the Julian calendar
    (holiday-sexp SEXP STRING) SEXP is a Gregorian-date-valued expression
                               in the variable `year'; if it evaluates to
                               a visible date, that's the holiday; if it
                               evaluates to nil, there's no holiday.  STRING
                               is an expression in the variable `date'.

For example, to add Bastille Day, celebrated in France on July 14, add

     (holiday-fixed 7 14 \"Bastille Day\")

to the list.  To add Hurricane Supplication Day, celebrated in the Virgin
Islands on the fourth Monday in August, add

     (holiday-float 8 1 4 \"Hurricane Supplication Day\")

to the list (the last Monday would be specified with `-1' instead of `4').
To add the last day of Hanukkah to the list, use

     (holiday-hebrew 10 2 \"Last day of Hanukkah\")

since the Hebrew months are numbered with 1 starting from Nisan, while to
add the Islamic feast celebrating Mohammed's birthday use

     (holiday-islamic 3 12 \"Mohammed's Birthday\")

since the Islamic months are numbered from 1 starting with Muharram.  To
add Thomas Jefferson's birthday, April 2, 1743 (Julian), use

     (holiday-julian 4 2 \"Jefferson's Birthday\")

To include a holiday conditionally, use the sexp form or a conditional.  For
example, to include American presidential elections, which occur on the first
Tuesday after the first Monday in November of years divisible by 4, add

     (holiday-sexp
       (if (zerop (% year 4))
           (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
             (1+ (calendar-dayname-on-or-before
                   1 (+ 6 (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian
                            (list 11 1 year)))))))
       \"US Presidential Election\")

or

     (if (zerop (% displayed-year 4))
         (holiday-fixed 11
                (extract-calendar-day
                 (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute

                \"US Presidential Election\"))

to the list.  To include the phases of the moon, add

     (lunar-phases)

to the holiday list, where `lunar-phases' is an Emacs-Lisp function that
you've written to return a (possibly empty) list of the relevant VISIBLE dates

The three months appear side by side, with the current month in the middle
surrounded by the previous and next months.  The cursor is put on today's date.

If called with an optional prefix argument, prompts for month and year.

This function is suitable for execution in a .emacs file; appropriate setting
of the variable `view-diary-entries-initially' will cause the diary entries for
the current date to be displayed in another window.  The value of the variable
`number-of-diary-entries' controls the number of days of diary entries
displayed upon initial display of the calendar.

An optional prefix argument ARG causes the calendar displayed to be ARG
months in the future if ARG is positive or in the past if ARG is negative;
in this case the cursor goes on the first day of the month.

Once in the calendar window, future or past months can be moved into view.
Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar can be scrolled forward
or backward.

The cursor can be moved forward or backward by one day, one week, one month,
or one year.  All of these commands take prefix arguments which, when negative,
cause movement in the opposite direction.  For convenience, the digit keys
and the minus sign are automatically prefixes.  The window is replotted as
necessary to display the desired date.

Diary entries can be marked on the calendar or displayed in another window.

Use M-x describe-mode for details of the key bindings in the calendar window.

The Gregorian calendar is assumed.

After loading the calendar, the hooks given by the variable
`calendar-load-hook' are run.  This is the place to add key bindings to the
calendar-mode-map.

After preparing the calendar window initially, the hooks given by the variable
`initial-calendar-window-hook' are run.

The hooks given by the variable `today-visible-calendar-hook' are run
every time the calendar window gets scrolled, if the current date is visible
in the window.  If it is not visible, the hooks given by the variable
`today-invisible-calendar-hook' are run.  Thus, for example, setting
`today-visible-calendar-hook' to 'calendar-star-date will cause today's date
to be replaced by asterisks to highlight it whenever it is in the window."
