;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines a menu of faces (bold, italic, etc) which allows you to
;; set the face used for a region of the buffer.  Some faces also have
;; keybindings, which are shown in the menu.  Faces with names beginning with
;; "fg:" or "bg:", as in "fg:red", are treated specially.
;; Such faces are assumed to consist only of a foreground (if "fg:") or
;; background (if "bg:") color.  They are thus put into the color submenus
;; rather than the general Face submenu.  These faces can also be
;; automatically created by selecting the "Other..." menu items in the
;; "Foreground" and "Background" submenus.
;;
;; The menu also contains submenus for indentation and justification-changing
;; commands.

;;; Usage:
;; Selecting a face from the menu or typing the keyboard equivalent will
;; change the region to use that face.  If you use transient-mark-mode and the
;; region is not active, the face will be remembered and used for the next
;; insertion.  It will be forgotten if you move point or make other
;; modifications before inserting or typing anything.
;;
;; Faces can be selected from the keyboard as well.  
;; The standard keybindings are M-g (or ESC g) + letter:
;; M-g i = "set italic",  M-g b = "set bold", etc.

;;; Customization:
;; An alternative set of keybindings that may be easier to type can be set up
;; using "Alt" or "Hyper" keys.  This requires that you either have or create
;; an Alt or Hyper key on your keyboard.  On my keyboard, there is a key
;; labeled "Alt", but to make it act as an Alt key I have to put this command
;; into my .xinitrc:
;;    xmodmap -e "add Mod3 = Alt_L"
;; Or, I can make it into a Hyper key with this:
;;    xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Hyper_L" -e "add Mod2 = Hyper_L"
;; Check with local X-perts for how to do it on your system.
;; Then you can define your keybindings with code like this in your .emacs:
;;   (setq facemenu-keybindings
;;    '((default     . [?\H-d])
;;      (bold        . [?\H-b])
;;      (italic      . [?\H-i])
;;      (bold-italic . [?\H-l])
;;      (underline   . [?\H-u])))
;;   (facemenu-update)
;;   (setq facemenu-keymap global-map)
;;   (define-key global-map [?\H-c] 'facemenu-set-foreground) ; set fg color
;;   (define-key global-map [?\H-C] 'facemenu-set-background) ; set bg color
;;
;; The order of the faces that appear in the menu and their keybindings can be
;; controlled by setting the variables `facemenu-keybindings' and
;; `facemenu-new-faces-at-end'.  List faces that you don't use in documents
;; (eg, `region') in `facemenu-unlisted-faces'.

;;; Known Problems:
;; Bold and Italic do not combine to create bold-italic if you select them
;; both, although most other combinations (eg bold + underline + some color)
;; do the intuitive thing.
;;
;; There is at present no way to display what the faces look like in
;; the menu itself.
;;
;; `list-faces-display' shows the faces in a different order than
;; this menu, which could be confusing.  I do /not/ sort the list
;; alphabetically, because I like the default order: it puts the most
;; basic, common fonts first.
;;
;; Please send me any other problems, comments or ideas.
