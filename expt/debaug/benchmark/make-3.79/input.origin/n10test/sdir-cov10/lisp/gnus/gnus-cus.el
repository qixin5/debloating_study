This will be used when doing followups and posts.

This is primarily useful in mail groups that represent closed
mailing lists--mailing lists where it's expected that everybody that
writes to the mailing list is subscribed to it.  Since using this
parameter ensures that the mail only goes to the mailing list itself,
it means that members won't receive two copies of your followups.

Using `to-address' will actually work whether the group is foreign or
not.  Let's say there's a group on the server that is called
`fa.4ad-l'.  This is a real newsgroup, but the server has gotten the
articles from a mail-to-news gateway.  Posting directly to this group
is therefore impossible--you have to send mail to the mailing list
address instead.")

also want to see any new threads.

You can do this with the following two score file entries:

     (orphan -500)
     (mark-and-expunge -100)

When you enter the group the first time, you will only see the new
threads.  You then raise the score of the threads that you find
interesting (with `I T' or `I S'), and ignore (`C y') the rest.
Next time you enter the group, you will see new articles in the
interesting threads, plus any new threads.

adaptive scoring on most groups, you'd set `gnus-use-adaptive-scoring'

You can have an arbitrary number of score entries for this header,
each score entry has four elements:

1. The \"match element\".  This should be the string to look for in the
   header.

2. The \"score element\".  This number should be an integer in the
   neginf to posinf interval.  This number is added to the score
   of the article if the match is successful.  If this element is
   not present, the `gnus-score-interactive-default-score' number
   will be used instead.  This is 1000 by default.

3. The \"date element\".  This date says when the last time this score
   entry matched, which provides a mechanism for expiring the
   score entries.  It this element is not present, the score
   entry is permanent.  The date is represented by the number of
   days since December 31, 1 ce.

4. The \"type element\".  This element specifies what function should
   be used to see whether this score entry matches the article.

   There are the regexp, as well as substring types, and exact match,
   and word match types.  If this element is not present, Gnus will
   assume that substring matching should be used.  There is case

For the Date header we have three kinda silly match types: `before',
`at' and `after'.  I can't really imagine this ever being useful, but,
like, it would feel kinda silly not to provide this function.  Just in
case.  You never know.  Better safe than sorry.  Once burnt, twice
shy.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  Never not have sex on a first
date.  (I have been told that at least one person, and I quote,
\"found this function indispensable\", however.)

A more useful match type is `regexp'.  With it, you can match the date
string using a regular expression.  The date is normalized to ISO8601
compact format first---`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS'.  If you want to match all
articles that have been posted on April 1st in every year, you could
use `....0401.........' as a match string, for instance.  (Note that
the date is kept in its original time zone, so this will match
articles that were posted when it was April 1st where the article was
posted from.  Time zones are such wholesome fun for the whole family,
eh?")))
