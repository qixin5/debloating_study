;;; Commentary:

;; This code provides a function, `man', with which you can browse
;; UNIX manual pages.  Formatting is done in background so that you
;; can continue to use your Emacs while processing is going on.
;;
;; The mode also supports hypertext-like following of manual page SEE
;; ALSO references, and other features.  See below or do `?' in a
;; manual page buffer for details.

;; ========== Credits and History ========== 
;; In mid 1991, several people posted some interesting improvements to
;; man.el from the standard emacs 18.57 distribution.  I liked many of
;; these, but wanted everything in one single package, so I decided
;; to incorporate them into a single manual browsing mode.  While
;; much of the code here has been rewritten, and some features added,
;; these folks deserve lots of credit for providing the initial
;; excellent packages on which this one is based.

;; Nick Duffek <duffek@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu>, posted a very nice
;; improvement which retrieved and cleaned the manpages in a
;; background process, and which correctly deciphered such options as
;; man -k.

;; Eric Rose <erose@jessica.stanford.edu>, submitted manual.el which
;; provided a very nice manual browsing mode.

;; This package was available as `superman.el' from the LCD package
;; for some time before it was accepted into Emacs 19.  The entry
;; point and some other names have been changed to make it a drop-in
;; replacement for the old man.el package.

;; Francesco Potorti` <pot@cnuce.cnr.it> cleaned it up thoroughly,
;; making it faster, more robust and more tolerant of different
;; systems' man idiosyncrasies.

;; ========== Features ==========
;; + Runs "man" in the background and pipes the results through a
;;   series of sed and awk scripts so that all retrieving and cleaning
;;   is done in the background. The cleaning commands are configurable.
;; + Syntax is the same as Un*x man
;; + Functionality is the same as Un*x man, including "man -k" and
;;   "man <section>", etc.
;; + Provides a manual browsing mode with keybindings for traversing
;;   the sections of a manpage, following references in the SEE ALSO
;;   section, and more.
;; + Multiple manpages created with the same man command are put into
;;   a narrowed buffer circular list.

;; ============= TODO ===========
;; - Add a command for printing.
;; - The awk script deletes multiple blank lines.  This behaviour does
;;   not allow to understand if there was indeed a blank line at the
;;   end or beginning of a page (after the header, or before the
;;   footer).  A different algorithm should be used.  It is easy to
;;   compute how many blank lines there are before and after the page
;;   headers, and after the page footer.  But it is possible to compute
;;   the number of blank lines before the page footer by euristhics
;;   only.  Is it worth doing?
;; - Allow a user option to mean that all the manpages should go in
;;   the same buffer, where they can be browsed with M-n and M-p.
;; - Allow completion on the manpage name when calling man.  This
;;   requires a reliable list of places where manpages can be found.  The
;;   drawback would be that if the list is not complete, the user might
;;   be led to believe that the manpages in the missing directories do
;;   not exist.
