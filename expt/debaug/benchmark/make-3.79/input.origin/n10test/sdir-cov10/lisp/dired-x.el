;;; Commentary:

;; This is Sebastian Kremer's excellent dired-x.el (Dired Extra), version
;; 1.191, hacked up for GNU Emacs 19.  Redundant or conflicting material
;; has been removed or renamed in order to work properly with dired of
;; GNU Emacs 19.  All suggestions or comments are most welcomed.

;;  
;; Please, PLEASE, *PLEASE* see the info pages.
;; 

;; BUGS: Type M-x dired-x-submit-report and a report will be generated.

;; INSTALLATION: In your ~/.emacs,
;;
;; (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
;;           (function (lambda ()
;;                       (load "dired-x")
;;                       ;; Set global variables here.  For example:
;;                       ;; (setq dired-guess-shell-gnutar "gtar")
;;                       )))
;; (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
;;           (function (lambda ()
;;                       ;; Set buffer-local variables here.  For example:
;;                       ;; (setq dired-omit-files-p t)
;;                       )))
;;
;; At load time dired-x.el will install itself, redefine some functions, and
;; bind some dired keys.  *Please* see the info pages for more details.

;; CAUTION: If you are using a version of GNU Emacs earlier than 19.20 than
;; you may have to edit dired.el.  The copy of dired.el in GNU Emacs versions
;; earlier than 19.20 incorrectly had the call to run-hooks *before* the call
;; to provide.  In such a case, it is possible that byte-compiling and/or
;; loading dired can cause an infinite loop.  To prevent this, make sure the
;; line of code
;;  
;;         (run-hooks 'dired-load-hook) 
;;  
;; is the *last* executable line in the file dired.el.  That is, make sure it
;; comes *after* the line
;;  
;;         (provide 'dired) 
;; 
;; *Please* see the info pages for more details.

;;   dired-read-shell-command         ../lisp/dired-aux.el
;;
;; One drawback is that dired-x.el will load dired-aux.el as soon as dired is
;; loaded.  Thus, the advantage of separating out non-essential dired stuff
;; into dired-aux.el and only loading when necessary will be lost.  Please
;; note also that some of the comments in dired.el and dired-aux.el are
;; Kremer's that referred to the old dired-x.el.  This now should be referring
;; to this program.  (This is also a good reason to call this dired-x.el
;; instead of dired-x19.el.)


;;; Code:

;; LOAD.

;; This is a no-op if dired-x is being loaded via `dired-load-hook'.  It is

;;; VISIT ALL MARKED FILES SIMULTANEOUSLY.

;;;
;;; * Use `dired-get-marked-files' to collect the marked files in the current
;;;   Dired Buffer into a list of filenames `FILE-LIST'.
;;;
;;; * Pass FILE-LIST to `dired-simultaneous-find-file' all with
;;;   `dired-do-find-marked-files''s prefix argument NOSELECT.
;;;
;;; * `dired-simultaneous-find-file' runs through FILE-LIST decrementing the
;;;   list each time.
;;;
;;; * If NOSELECT is non-nil then just run `find-file-noselect'  on each
;;;   element of FILE-LIST.
;;;
;;; * If NOSELECT is nil then calculate the `size' of the window for each file
;;;   by dividing the `window-height' by length of FILE-LIST.  Thus, `size' is
;;;   cognizant of the window-configuration.
;;;
;;; * If `size' is too small abort, otherwise run `find-file' on each element
;;;   of FILE-LIST giving each a window of height `size'.
