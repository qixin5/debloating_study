* Give start-process the ability to direct standard-error
  output to a different filter.

* Make compile.el record the markers that point to error loci
  on text properties in the error message lines.

* Make desktop.el save the "frame configuration" of Emacs (in some
  useful sense).

* Make movemail work with IMAP.

* Add ANSI C prototype forward declarations to the source files,
  so that even the functions used within one file have prototypes.

* Replace finder.el with something that generates an Info file
  which gives the same information through a menu structure.

* Implement a variant of uncompress.el or jka-compr.el that
  works with GNU Privacy Guard for encryption.

* Save undo information in files, and reload it when needed
  for undoing.

* modify comint.el so that input appears in a special font.
  I can add a simple Emacs feature to help.

* Implement other text formatting properties.
** Footnotes that can appear either in place
  or at the end of the page.
** text property that says "don't break line in middle of this".
  Don't break the line between two characters that have the
  same value of this property.
** Discretionary hyphens that disappear at end of line.

* Implement use of mmap to allocate buffers, when mmap exists.

* Change the Windows NT menu code
  so that it handles the deep_p argument and avoids
  regenerating the whole menu bar menu tree except
  when the user tries to use the menubar.

  This requires the RIT to forward the WM_INITMENU message to
  the main thread, and not return from that message until the main
  thread has processed the menu_bar_activate_event and regenerated
  the whole menu bar.  In the mean time, it should process other messages.
