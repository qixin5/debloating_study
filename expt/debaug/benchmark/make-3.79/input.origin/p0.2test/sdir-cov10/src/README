This directory contains the source files for the C component of GNU Emacs.
Nothing in this directory is needed for using Emacs once it is built
and installed, if the dumped Emacs (on Unix systems) or the Emacs
executable and map files (on VMS systems) are copied elsewhere.

See the files ../README and then ../INSTALL for installation instructions.

Under GNU and Unix systems, the file `Makefile.in' is used as a
template by the script `../configure' to produce `Makefile.c'.  The
same script then uses `cpp' to produce the machine-dependent
`Makefile' from `Makefile.c'; `Makefile' is the file which actually
controls the compilation of Emacs.  Most of this should work
transparently to the user; you should only need to run `../configure',
and then type `make'.

See the file VMSBUILD in this directory for instructions on compiling,
linking and building Emacs on VMS.

The files `*.com' and `temacs.opt' are used on VMS only.
The files `vlimit.h', `ioclt.h' and `param.h' are stubs to
allow compilation on VMS with the minimum amount of #ifdefs.

`uaf.h' contains VMS uaf structure definitions.  This is only needed if
you define READ_SYSUAF.  This should only be done for single-user
systems where you are not overly concerned with security, since it
either requires that you install Emacs with SYSPRV or make SYSUAF.DAT
world readable.  Otherwise, Emacs can determine information about the
current user, but no one else.

`pwd.h' contains definitions for VMS to be able to correctly simulate
`getpwdnam' and `getpwduid'.
