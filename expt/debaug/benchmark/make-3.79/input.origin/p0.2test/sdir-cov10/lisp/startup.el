;;; Commentary:

;; This file parses the command line and gets Emacs running.  Options on
;; the command line are handled in precedence order.  The order is the
;; one in the list below; first described means first handled.  Options
;; within each category (delimited by a bar) are handled in the order
;; encountered on the command line.

;; -------------------------
;; -version                  Print Emacs version to stderr, then exit
;; --version                 successfully right away.
;;                           This option is handled by emacs.c
;; -------------------------
;; -help                     Print a short usage description and exit
;; --help                    successfully right away.
;;                           This option is handled by emacs.c
;; -------------------------
;; -nl                       Do not use shared memory (for systems that
;; -no-shared-memory         support this) for the dumped Emacs data.
;;                           This option is handled by emacs.c
;;
;; -map                      For VMS.
;; --map-data                This option is handled by emacs.c
;; -------------------------
;; -t FILE                   Use FILE as the name of the terminal.
;; --terminal FILE           Using this implies "-nw" also.
;;                           This option is handled by emacs.c
;; -------------------------
;; -d DISPNAME               Use DISPNAME as the name of the X-windows
;; -display DISPNAME         display for the initial frame.
;; --display DISPNAME        This option is handled by emacs.c
;; -------------------------
;; -nw                       Do not use a windows system (but use the
;; --no-windows              terminal instead.)
;;                           This option is handled by emacs.c
;; -------------------------
;; -batch                    Execute noninteractively (messages go to stdout,
;; --batch                   variable noninteractive set to t)
;;                           This option is handled by emacs.c
;; -------------------------
;; -q                        Do not load user's init file and do not load
;; -no-init-file             "default.el".  Regardless of this switch,
;; --no-init-file            "site-start" is still loaded.
;; -------------------------
;; -no-site-file             Do not load "site-start.el".  (This is the ONLY
;; --no-site-file            way to prevent loading that file.)
;; -------------------------
;; -u USER                   Load USER's init file instead of the init
;; -user USER                file belonging to the user starting Emacs.
;; --user USER
;; -------------------------
;; -debug-init               Don't catch errors in init files; let the
;; --debug-init              debugger run.
;; -------------------------
;; -i ICONTYPE               Set type of icon using when Emacs is
;; -itype ICONTYPE           iconified under X-windows.
;; --icon-type ICONTYPE      This option is passed on to term/x-win.el
;;
;; -iconic                   Start Emacs iconified under X-windows.
;; --iconic                  This option is passed on to term/x-win.el
;; -------------------------
;; Various X-windows options for colors/fonts/geometry/title etc.
;; These options are passed on to term/x-win.el which see.  Certain
;; of these are also found in term/pc-win.el
;; -------------------------
;; FILE                      Visit FILE.
;;
;; -L DIRNAME                Add DIRNAME to load-path
;; -directory DIRNAME
;; --directory DIRNAME
;;
;; -l FILE                   Load and execute the Emacs lisp code
;; -load FILE                in FILE.
;; --load FILE
;;
;; -f FUNC                   Execute Emacs lisp function FUNC with
;; -funcall FUNC             no arguments.  The "-e" form is outdated
;; --funcall FUNC            and should not be used.  (It's a typo
;; -e FUNC                   promoted to a feature.)
;;
;; -eval FORM                Execute Emacs lisp form FORM.
;; --eval FORM
