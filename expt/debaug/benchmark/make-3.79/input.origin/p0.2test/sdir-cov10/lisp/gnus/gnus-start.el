  "*Non-nil means that Gnus will run `gnus-find-new-newsgroups' at startup.
This normally finds new newsgroups by comparing the active groups the
servers have already reported with those Gnus already knows, either alive
or killed.

When any of the following are true, `gnus-find-new-newsgroups' will instead
ask the servers (primary, secondary, and archive servers) to list new
groups since the last time it checked:
  1. This variable is `ask-server'.
  2. This variable is a list of select methods (see below).
  3. `gnus-read-active-file' is nil or `some'.
  4. A prefix argument is given to `gnus-find-new-newsgroups' interactively.

Thus, if this variable is `ask-server' or a list of select methods or
`gnus-read-active-file' is nil or `some', then the killed list is no
longer necessary, so you could safely set `gnus-save-killed-list' to nil.

This variable can be a list of select methods which Gnus will query with
the `ask-server' method in addition to the primary, secondary, and archive
servers.

Eg.
  (setq gnus-check-new-newsgroups
	'((nntp \"some.server\") (nntp \"other.server\")))

If this variable is nil, then you have to tell Gnus explicitly to
check for new newsgroups with \\<gnus-group-mode-map>\\[gnus-find-new-newsgroups]."

If this variable is `some', Gnus will try to only read the relevant
parts of the active file from the server.  Not all servers support
this, and it might be quite slow with other servers, but this should
generally be faster than both the t and nil value.

If you set this variable to nil or `some', you probably still want to
be told about new newsgroups that arrive.  To do that, set
`gnus-check-new-newsgroups' to `ask-server'.  This may not work
