How to get GNU Software by Internet FTP or by UUCP.  Last updated 1999-01-20

* Please send improvements to this file to gnu@gnu.org.

* No Warranties

We distribute software in the hope that it will be useful, but without
any warranty.  No author or distributor of this software accepts
responsibility to anyone for the consequences of using it or for
whether it serves any particular purpose or works at all, unless he
says so in writing. This is exactly the same warranty that the commercial
software companies offer: None. If the distribution is incomplete or the
media fails, you can always download a replacement from any of the GNU
mirrors, free of charge.

* Updates

A possibly more up-to-date list of GNU FTP sites is at
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html

* How to FTP

Use the ftp program on your system (ask locally if you can't find it)
to connect to the host you are ftping from.  Unless indicated
otherwise, login in as user "anonymous", with password: "your e-mail
address" and set "binary" mode (to transfer all eight bits in each
byte).

ALWAYS USE BINARY/IMAGE MODE TO TRANSFER THESE FILES!
Text mode does not work for tar files or compressed files.

* GNU Software and How To FTP It

GNU software is available on ftp.gnu.org under the directory /gnu.
diff files to convert between versions exist for some of these
programs.  Some programs have misc support files as well.  Have a look
on ftp.gnu.org to see which ones.  In most cases, the tar or diff
files are compressed with the `gzip' program; this is indicated with
the .gz suffix.

Descriptions of GNU software are available at
	http://www.gnu.org/software/software.html

* Alternative Internet FTP Sources

Please do NOT use a site outside your country, until you have checked
all sites inside your country, and then your continent.  Trans-ocean
TCP/IP links are very expensive and usually very low speed.

The canonical GNU ftp site is located at ftp.gnu.org/gnu.
You should probably use one of the many mirrors of that site - the
mirrors will be less busy, and you can find one closer to your site.

* How to FTP GNU Emacs

Emacs is in the directory /gnu/emacs on ftp.gnu.org.  The emacs
distribution itself has a filename in the form emacs-M.N.tar.gz, where
M and N stand for the version numbers; the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual
is in a separate file, named elisp-manual-NN.tar.gz.

* Scheme and How to FTP It

The latest distribution version of C Scheme is available via anonymous FTP
from swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu in /pub/scheme-X.X/ (where X.X is some version
number).

Read the files INSTALL and README in the top level C Scheme directory.

* TeX and How to Obtain It

We don't distribute TeX now, but it is free software.

TeX is a document formatter that is used, among other things, by the FSF
for all its documentation.  You will need it if you want to make printed
manuals.

TeX is freely redistributable.  You can get it by ftp, tape, or CD/ROM.

** For FTP instructions, retrieve the file
ftp.cs.umb.edu/pub/tex/unixtex.ftp. (We don't include it here because it
changes relatively frequently.  Sorry.)

** A minimal TeX collection (enough to process Texinfo files, anyway)
is included on the GNU source CD-ROM.  See the file ORDERS in this
directory for more information.

* VMS FTP sites with GNU Software
You can anonymously ftp a VMS version of GNU emacs from:
	- ftp.vms.stacken.kth.se:[.GNU-VMS] - GNU Emacs and some other VMS
ports (and some VMS binaries) of GNU software
	- mango.rsmas.miami.edu has a VMS version of the GCC/G++ compiler.
Contact angel@flipper.miami.edu (angel li) for details.
	- RIGEL.EFD.LTH.SE [130.235.48.3] - GNU Emacs

* Getting GNU software in Great Britain

jpo@cs.nott.ac.uk is willing to distribute those GNU sources he has
available.  The smaller items are available from the info-server (send
to info-server@cs.nott.ac.uk); the larger items by negotiation.  Due to
communication costs this service is only available within the UK.

BattenIG@computer-science.birmingham.ac.uk (aka
I.G.Batten@fulcrum.bt.co.uk) is also willing to distribute those GNU
sources he has.

wizards@doc.ic.ac.uk is willing to distribute those GNU sources they have
along with most other freely distributable software.  The SunSITE archive
on SunSITE.doc.ic.ac.uk (193.63.255.4) is available via ftp, http, fsp,
gopher, NFS and Lanmanger over IP (SMB), and telnet.

UK sites with just anonymous FTP access are in the above list.

* Getting GNU software via UUCP

OSU is distributing via UUCP: most GNU software, MIT C Scheme,
Compress, News, RN, NNTP, Patch, some Appletalk stuff, some of the
Internet Requests For Comment (RFC) et al..  See their periodic
postings on the Usenet newsgroup comp.sources.d for informational
updates.  Current details from <staff@cis.ohio-state.edu> or
<...!osu-cis!staff>.

Information on how to uucp some GNU programs is available via
electronic mail from: uunet!hutch!barber, hqda-ai!merlin, acornrc!bob,
hao!scicom!qetzal!upba!ugn!nepa!denny, ncar!noao!asuvax!hrc!dan,
bigtex!james (aka james@bigtex.cactus.org), oli-stl!root,
src@contrib.de (Germany), toku@dit.co.jp (Japan) and info@ftp.uu.net.

* If You Like The Software

If you like the software developed and distributed by the Free
Software Foundation, please express your satisfaction with a donation.
Your donations will help to support the Foundation and make our future
efforts successful, including a complete development and operating
system, called GNU (Gnu's Not Unix), which will run Unix user
programs.  For more information on GNU and the Foundation, contact us
at the above address, or see our web site at http://www.gnu.org.

Ordering a GNU Source Code CD-ROM or Source Code CD-ROM Subscription
is a good way for your organization to help support our work.
