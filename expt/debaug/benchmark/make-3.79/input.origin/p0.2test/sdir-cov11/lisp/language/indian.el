;; For Indian, the character set IS 13194 is supported.
;;
;; IS 13194 does not specifically assign glyphs for each characters.
;; Following code is not specific to each Indian language.
;;
;; Eventually, this code will support generic information about
;; following scripts.
;;
;;    Devanagari
;;    Bengali
;;    Gurmukhi
;;    Gujarati
;;    Oriya
;;    Tamil
;;    Telgu
;;    Kannada
;;    Malayalam
;;
;; In this file, charsets other than charset-ascii and charset-indian-is13194
;; should not be used except in the comment.

;;; Code:

;;  Followings are what you see when you refer to the Emacs
;;  representations of IS 13194 charcters.  However, this is merely
;;  tentative apperance, and you must convert them by
;;  indian-to-xxxxxx(specific script) function to use them.
;;  Devanagari is not an exception of this rule.

;;     0xa0 //(5!"#$%&'()*+,-./(B
;;     0xb0 (50123456789:;<=>?(B
;;     0xc0 (5@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO(B
;;     0xd0 (5PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_(B
;;     0xe0 (5`abcdefghijklmno(B
;;     0xf0 (5pqrstuvwxyz{|}~(B//

;; Note - In IS 13194, several symbols are obtained by special
;; combination of several characters and Nukta sign.
;;
;;   Sanskrit Vowel R  -> (5*(B + (5i(B
;;   Sanskrit Vowel L  -> (5&(B + (5i(B
;;   Sanskrit Vowel LL -> (5'(B + (5i(B
;;   Sanskrit Avagrah  -> (5j(B + (5i(B
;;   OM                -> (5!(B + (5i(B
;;
;; Note - IS 13194 defines ATR(0xEF) and EXT(0xF0), but they are
;; not used in Emacs.
;;
;; Note - the above characters DO NOT represent any script.  For
;; example, if you want to obtain Devanagari character, you must do
;; something like the following.
;;
;;   (char-to-string (indian-to-devanagari ?(5$(B))
;;   "$(5!$(B"

;;; ITRANS
;;
;; ITRANS is one of the most popular method to exchange indian scripts
;; electronically.  Here is the table to convert between ITRANS code and
;; IS 13194 code.
