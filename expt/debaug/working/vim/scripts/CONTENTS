CONTENTS <scripts>

The scripts directory contains 4 scripts for general use, and one sub-directory.
Other scripts are dependencies of the main scripts, and need not be used
directly. The four scripts are as follows:

  runall:  The runall script is the primary script for running the testcases for
  vim. For instructions on using this script see the README file.  In function
  this, script runs the entire testsuite on the version stored in the source
  directory. The script can run this process on any of the versions included
  with vim.

  runall-diff:  The runall-diff script runs on the currently compiled script.
  This means that you will need to inject the fault to be analyzed after running
  a clean runall. 

  clean:  The clean script to uninstall vim, deletes contents of the source
  directory.

  makevers:  The makevers script copies, compiles, and installs one version of
  vim to the active source directory.  Note that this script must be manually
  modified to install the original versions since it is hardcoded to install
  the seeded version.

  copy_version: simply copies the seeded version (hardcoded) into the source
  directory but does not perform the compile step.  This is useful if you
  automate the task of inserting faults by using this script first then doing
  the fault seed step and compile.

  compile: a script that performs the compile on the object.  When used with
  the copy_version script a wrapping script to automate the fault seeding
  and fault matrix creation activities.

  get_script_name: a perl script that searches for tests within a given
  directory heirarchy.  This script is the basis for the runall scripts.

  COMPILE: the output file of the compilation step.
