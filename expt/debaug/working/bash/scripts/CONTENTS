clean
-----
Running ./clean will remove any contents of the "source" directory.

compile
-------
Running ./compile <fault name> will compile the version of bash in 
the "source" directory with the indicated fault.

makevers
--------
running makevers <version number> will copy the source of the appropriate
seeded version into the source directory and execute a make (build) of
the bash object, installing it into the source/bin directory where the
runall and runall-diff scripts expect to find it.  Use this in lieu of
the copy_version in most cases.

copy_version
------------
Running ./copy_version <version number> will copy the souce code of the appropriate
seeded version to the "source" directory.

get_script_name
---------------
Running ./get_script_name <test number> will report back with the 
indicated test's file name.

runall
------
Running ./runall <version number> will run the specified test set on the 
version compiled in the "source" directory.  Note: runall is unaware 
of which version is compiled in the "source" directory.  Therefore, a 
proper test set must be specified.

runall-diff
-----------
Running ./runall-diff <version number> runs the specified test set on bash 
and then compares the output to the associated ".right" file included with 
the bash test set.  Final diff output is sent to the outputs directory and 
the intermediate test outputs are discarded.
