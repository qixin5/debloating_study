%: %[DIGITS | WORD] [&]
    This is similar to the `fg' command.  Resume a stopped or background
    job.  If you specifiy DIGITS, then that job is used.  If you specify
    WORD, then the job whose name begins with WORD is used.  Following the
    job specification with a `&' places the job in the background.
.: . filename
    Read and execute commands from FILENAME and return.  The pathnames
    in $PATH are used to find the directory containing FILENAME.
:: :
    No effect; the command does nothing.  A zero exit code is returned.
[: [ arg... ]
    This is a synonym for the "test" builtin, but the last
    argument must be a literal `]', to match the opening `['.
