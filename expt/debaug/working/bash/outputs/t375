read: read [-ers] [-t timeout] [-p prompt] [-a array] [-n nchars] [-d delim] [name ...]
    One line is read from the standard input, and the first word is
    assigned to the first NAME, the second word to the second NAME, and so
    on, with leftover words assigned to the last NAME.  Only the characters
    found in $IFS are recognized as word delimiters.  If no NAMEs are supplied,
    the line read is stored in the REPLY variable.  If the -r option is given,
    this signifies `raw' input, and backslash escaping is disabled.  The
    -d option causes read to continue until the first character of DELIM is
    read, rather than newline.  If the `-p' option is supplied, the string
    PROMPT is output without a trailing newline before attempting to read.
    If -a is supplied, the words read are assigned to sequential indices of
    ARRAY, starting at zero.  If -e is supplied and the shell is interactive,
    readline is used to obtain the line.  If -n is supplied with a non-zero
    NCHARS argument, read returns after NCHARS characters have been read.
    The -s option causes input coming from a terminal to not be echoed.
    
    The -t option causes read to time out and return failure if a complete line
    of input is not read within TIMEOUT seconds.  The return code is zero,
    unless end-of-file is encountered or read times out.
readonly: readonly [-anf] [name ...] or readonly -p
    The given NAMEs are marked readonly and the values of these NAMEs may
    not be changed by subsequent assignment.  If the -f option is given,
    then functions corresponding to the NAMEs are so marked.  If no
    arguments are given, or if `-p' is given, a list of all readonly names
    is printed.  An argument of `-n' says to remove the readonly property
    from subsequent NAMEs.  The `-a' option means to treat each NAME as
    an array variable.  An argument of `--' disables further option
    processing.
return: return [n]
    Causes a function to exit with the return value specified by N.  If N
    is omitted, the return status is that of the last command.
