IMPORTANT NOTES
===============
* Before attempting to run this subject, set the environment variable
  'experiment_root' to point to the directory containing the make
  infrastructure directory (e.g. the directory containing the 'make'
  directory).

* When using MakeTestScript (mts) to generate scripts for this subject, always
  use a value for the '--experiment-dir' parameter that resolves to an
  absolute path. Using the 'experiment_root' environment variable is suggested. 
  Using a relative path will cause certain test cases to fail.

* An example, if mts (and you, the user) is in your subject/scripts directory:

# mts ${experiment_root}/make ${experiment_root}/make/source/make.exe ${experiment_root}/make/testplans.alt/v0/v0_3.tsl.universe R runall NULL NULL

  This will create a runall script called "runall" in your scripts directory.
