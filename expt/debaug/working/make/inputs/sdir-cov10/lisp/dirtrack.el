;;; Commentary:

;; Shell directory tracking by watching the prompt.
;;
;; This is yet another attempt at a directory-tracking package for
;; Emacs shell-mode. However, this package makes one strong assumption:
;; that you can customize your shell's prompt to contain the
;; current working directory. Most shells do support this, including
;; almost every type of Bourne and C shell on Unix, the native shells on
;; Windows95 (COMMAND.COM) and Windows NT (CMD.EXE), and most 3rd party
;; Windows shells. If you cannot do this, or do not wish to, this package
;; will be useless to you.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; 1) Set your shell's prompt to contain the current working directory.
;; You may need to consult your shell's documentation to find out how to
;; do this.
;; 
;; Note that directory tracking is done by matching regular expressions, 
;; therefore it is *VERY IMPORTANT* for your prompt to be easily
;; distinguishable from other output. If your prompt regexp is too general,
;; you will see error messages from the dirtrack filter as it attempts to cd
;; to non-existent directories.
;;
;; 2) Set the variable `dirtrack-list' to an appropriate value. This
;; should be a list of two elements: the first is a regular expression
;; which matches your prompt up to and including the pathname part.
;; The second is a number which tells which regular expression group to 
;; match to extract only the pathname. If you use a multi-line prompt,
;; add 't' as a third element. Note that some of the functions in
;; 'comint.el' assume a single-line prompt (eg, comint-bol).
;; 
;; Determining this information may take some experimentation. Setting
;; the variable `dirtrack-debug' may help; it causes the directory-tracking
;; filter to log messages to the buffer `dirtrack-debug-buffer'. You can easily
;; toggle this setting with the `dirtrack-debug-toggle' function.
;; 
;; 3) Add a hook to shell-mode to enable the directory tracking:
;;
;; (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook
;;   (function (lambda ()
;; 	      (setq comint-preoutput-filter-functions
;; 		    (append (list 'dirtrack)
;; 			    comint-preoutput-filter-functions)))))
;;
;; You may wish to turn ordinary shell tracking off by calling
;; `shell-dirtrack-toggle' or setting `shell-dirtrackp'.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; 1) On Windows NT, my prompt is set to emacs$S$P$G.
;; 'dirtrack-list' is set to (list "^emacs \\([a-zA-Z]:.*\\)>" 1)
;;
;; 2) On Solaris running bash, my prompt is set like this:
;;    PS1="\w\012emacs@\h(\!) [\t]% "
;;    'dirtrack-list' is set to (list "^\\([/~].*\\)\nemacs@[^%]+% *" 1 t)
;;
;; I'd appreciate other examples from people who use this package.
;; 
;; Here's one from Stephen Eglen:
;;
;;   Running under tcsh:
;;   (setq-default dirtrack-list '("^%E \\([^ ]+\\)" 1))
;;   
;;   It might be worth mentioning in your file that emacs sources start up
;;   files of the form: ~/.emacs_<SHELL> where <SHELL> is the name of the
;;   shell.  So for example, I have the following in ~/.emacs_tcsh:
;;   
;;   set prompt = "%%E %~ %h% "
;;   
;;   This produces a prompt of the form:
;;   %E /var/spool 10% 
;;   
;;   This saves me from having to use the %E prefix in other non-emacs
;;   shells.
;;
;; A final note:
;; 
;;   I run LOTS of shell buffers through Emacs, sometimes as different users
;;   (eg, when logged in as myself, I'll run a root shell in the same Emacs).
;;   If you do this, and the shell prompt contains a ~, Emacs will interpret
;;   this relative to the user which owns the Emacs process, not the user
;;   who owns the shell buffer. This may cause dirtrack to behave strangely
;;   (typically it reports that it is unable to cd to a directory
;;   with a ~ in it).
;;
;;   The same behavior can occur if you use dirtrack with remote filesystems
;;   (using telnet, rlogin, etc) as Emacs will be checking the local
;;   filesystem, not the remote one. This problem is not specific to dirtrack,
;;   but also affects file completion, etc.
