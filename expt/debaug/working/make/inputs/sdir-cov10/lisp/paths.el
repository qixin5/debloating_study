They are searched in the order they are given in the list.
Therefore, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs
normally should come last (so that local files override standard ones).

Once Info is started, the list of directories to search
comes from the variable `Info-directory-list'.
This variable `Info-default-directory-list' is used as the default
for initializing `Info-directory-list' when Info is started, unless
the environment variable INFOPATH is set.")
